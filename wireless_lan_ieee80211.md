# 🌐 Wireless LAN and IEEE 802.11 Overview

## 🔧 What is Wireless LAN?

A **Wireless LAN** is a network where devices communicate using wireless protocols/technologies within a defined area.

---

## 📜 IEEE 802.11 Standard

IEEE 802.11 provides a standard for wireless LAN, covering two layers:

- **Physical Layer**
- **Data Link Layer**

---

## 📶 Wireless Services in IEEE 802.11
802.11 standard we have two kinds of services
## 1. **BSS (Basic Service Set)**

- A group/unit of wireless network devices communicating with the same **Access Point (AP)**.

### 2. **ESS (Extended Service Set)**

- A collection of multiple APs and their associated client stations, all united by a single **Distribution System Medium (DSM)**.
- The **ESSID** (Extended SSID) is the shared network name.
- The terms **SSID** and **ESSID** are often used interchangeably.

---

## 📡 Key Terms

- **BSSID**: The physical /MAC address of the AP (48-bit hex).
- **AP (Access Point)**:these are devices which accept Wireless signals from multiple devices and retransmit them to  the rest of the network.
  - Acts as a bridge between wireless devices and the wired network.
  - Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
- **SSID**: A unique string identifying a wireless network.
- **Ad-Hoc Mode**:
  - Peer-to-peer communication without AP.
  - Decentralized network, direct communication between stations.
- **Promiscuous Mode (Monitor Mode)**:
  - Allows a device to listen to all Wi-Fi packets over-the-air.

---

## 🧩 Data Link Layer Details:-
Data link layer is divided into two layers

### Two Sublayers:
1. **Logical Link Control (LLC)**
2. **Medium Access Control (MAC)**

---

## 🕹️ MAC Layer Functions:-
In Mac we have two more layers
### 1. **DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)**

- it provides contention Based Services i.e it uses **CSMA/CA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance).
- Operates on **half-duplex**.
- **csma\ca Timers** are used to avoid collisions.

> 📌 *CSMA/CA is for wireless, CSMA/CD is for wired.*

### 2. **PCF (Point Coordination Function)**

- Poll-based / priority-based access mechanism.

---

## 🔍 Scanning and Association

### What is Scanning?

The process by which a station associates with an AP.

### Scanning Steps:

1. Station sends a **probe request frame**.
2. Nearby APs respond with **probe response frames**.
3. Station sends an **association request** to the chosen AP.
4. AP sends back an **association response**.

### Scanning Types:

- **Active Scanning**: Station sends probe request → AP responds.
- **Passive Scanning**: APs periodically send **beacon frames**( advertising packets illustrating its capability to all stations).

---

# 📡 CSMA/CA in Wi-Fi: Problems Explained

## 🧠 What is CSMA/CA?

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)** is a network protocol used in **Wi-Fi** to manage how multiple devices share the same wireless channel.

> 💡 It tries to **avoid** collisions *before* they happen, unlike CSMA/CD (used in Ethernet), which handles collisions *after* they occur.

---

## ⚙️ How CSMA/CA Works (Simplified)

1. A device **"listens"** to check if the wireless channel is free.
2. If the channel is **idle**, it waits for a short, random time.
3. If still idle, it **sends** the data.
4. If the channel is **busy**, the device waits and tries again later.

---

## ❗ Common Problems with CSMA/CA in Wi-Fi

### 1. 🔇 Hidden Node Problem

#### 📍 What happens:
- Two devices (A and C) are **out of range** of each other but **both in range** of the same Access Point (B).
- A and C **can’t hear** each other.
- Both think the channel is free and **transmit at the same time** → causing a **collision** at B.

#### 📌 Real-World Analogy:
> Imagine two people in separate rooms trying to talk to the same receptionist over a walkie-talkie. They can’t hear each other and both talk at once, confusing the receptionist.

---

### 2. 📡 Exposed Node Problem

#### 📍 What happens:
- A device refrains from transmitting, thinking the channel is busy, even when its transmission **would not cause interference**.

#### 📌 Example:
- Device A is sending data to B.
- Device C wants to send data to D.
- C hears A's signal and assumes the channel is busy.
- But since C → D and A → B are **non-interfering**, it could have transmitted safely.

#### ❌ Result:
- **Unnecessary waiting** → **inefficient use** of the wireless channel.

---

### 3. 🐢 High Overhead from Waiting

- Due to **random backoff timers** and **acknowledgments**, there is a delay even when the network is idle.
- Leads to **reduced throughput**, especially with many devices.

---

### 4. 📶 Performance Drops with More Devices

- As more devices share the channel, the chances of collisions and delays increase.
- **Congestion** leads to **packet loss**, **retransmissions**, and **slower speeds**.

---

### 5. 🔁 No Central Control

- Wi-Fi uses a **distributed system**, so each device independently decides when to transmit.
- This can lead to **poor coordination**, especially in crowded networks.

---

## ✅ Summary of CSMA/CA Limitations

| **Issue**            | **Description**                                                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hidden Node          | Devices unaware of each other cause unintentional collisions               |
| Exposed Node         | Devices unnecessarily delay sending even when it's safe                    |
| Overhead             | Waiting, backoff, and acknowledgment mechanisms reduce speed               |
| Scalability          | Performance degrades as the number of users increases                      |
| Lack of Coordination | No central controller leads to inefficiencies in shared environments       |

---

## 🧠 Alternatives & Solutions

- 🧱 **RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send)**: Optional handshake that reduces hidden node collisions.
- 🚀 **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** introduces better coordination through **OFDMA** and **BSS Coloring**.
- 🛰️ **Mesh Networking** helps balance loads and reduce interference.

---

## 🌐 Final Thought

CSMA/CA is **essential** for wireless networking, but it comes with **challenges**, especially in **crowded** or **large** networks. Understanding these problems helps in designing **better Wi-Fi** systems and troubleshooting **connectivity issues**.



# 🔗 Fragmentation & Aggregation in Wi-Fi

In Wi-Fi, **performance** and **reliability** are affected by how data is packaged and transmitted. Two techniques that help optimize wireless communication are:

- **Fragmentation** – Breaking data into smaller pieces.
- **Aggregation** – Combining multiple data packets into one.

---

## ✂️ Fragmentation in Wi-Fi

### 📍 What is it?

**Fragmentation** divides a large data frame into smaller parts (fragments) before transmission.

### 💡 Why it’s used:

- To **reduce retransmission time** if a packet is lost or corrupted.
- Smaller fragments have a **higher chance of successful delivery**, especially in noisy environments.

### 🧠 How it works:

1. A large data frame is split into smaller fragments.
2. Each fragment is sent with its own **header** and **checksum**.
3. Only the **lost or corrupted fragment** needs to be retransmitted.

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Improved reliability** in environments with high interference.
- **Faster recovery** from transmission errors.

### ❌ Drawbacks:

- **More overhead** due to extra headers.
- Can **reduce throughput** if not managed properly.

---

## 📦 Aggregation in Wi-Fi

### 📍 What is it?

**Aggregation** combines multiple data packets into a **single larger frame** before transmission.

> Introduced in **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)** and enhanced in **Wi-Fi 5/6**, aggregation improves **efficiency**.

### 🧠 Types of Aggregation:

| **Type**    | **Full Name**                        | **Description**                                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A-MSDU**  | Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit     | Combines multiple data units at the **higher MAC layer**     |
| **A-MPDU**  | Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit    | Combines multiple MPDUs at the **lower MAC layer**           |

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Less overhead** (fewer headers per packet)
- **Higher throughput** and **better efficiency**
- Especially useful in **high-speed** or **low-error** environments

### ❌ Drawbacks:

- If one part of an aggregated frame is corrupted, **entire frame may need retransmission**
- **Delay-sensitive** applications may suffer due to buffering before aggregation

---
# 🧱 MPDU vs MSDU in Wi-Fi

In Wi-Fi communication, data flows through several layers. Two key units involved in packaging and transmitting this data are:

- **MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit)**
- **MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit)**

Understanding the difference between them helps in grasping how Wi-Fi handles data efficiency, error control, and speed.

---

## 📦 What is MSDU?

### ➕ Full Form:
**MAC Service Data Unit**

### 📍 Description:
An **MSDU** is a data packet received from the **upper layers** (like IP or TCP) and handed off to the **MAC layer** for transmission.

### 🔄 Example:
Think of it as a **customer's order** that needs to be packed before shipping.

### ✅ Key Points:

- Contains actual **payload** (user data)
- Sits at the **interface between Layer 2 and Layer 3** (Data Link ↔ Network)
- Before transmission, it's usually **converted into MPDU**

---

## 📡 What is MPDU?

### ➕ Full Form:
**MAC Protocol Data Unit**

### 📍 Description:
An **MPDU** is the **final packet** that is transmitted over the air by the Wi-Fi interface.

### 🔄 Example:
Think of it as the **shipping box** that actually leaves the warehouse.

### ✅ Key Points:

- Includes **MAC header**, **frame check sequence (FCS)**, and **possibly one or more MSDUs**
- It’s what actually gets **transmitted on the wireless medium**
- Can be aggregated (A-MPDU) for performance

---

## ⚙️ Flow of Data: From MSDU to MPDU

```text
App/Data → TCP/UDP → IP Packet → MSDU → MPDU → Wireless Transmission
```
## ⚖️ Fragmentation vs Aggregation

|                | **Fragmentation**                          | **Aggregation**                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Increase reliability                        | Improve efficiency and speed                 |
| **Use Case**    | Noisy environments, weak signals            | Clean environments, high-speed transmissions |
| **Overhead**    | High (more headers, more frames)            | Low (shared headers across packets)          |
| **Throughput**  | Can reduce throughput                       | Increases throughput                         |
| **Introduced In**| Legacy Wi-Fi (before 802.11n)              | 802.11n and later (Wi-Fi 4, 5, 6)            |

---

## 🏠 Real-World Analogy

### Fragmentation:
> Like sending multiple **smaller envelopes** instead of one big package when mailing fragile items — fewer chances of complete loss.

### Aggregation:
> Like putting several letters into a **single large envelope** to save on postage and time — more efficient, unless the envelope gets damaged.

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

- **Fragmentation** helps improve **reliability** by reducing the size of each transmission.
- **Aggregation** improves **efficiency** and **speed** by sending more data in fewer transmissions.
- **Modern Wi-Fi** standards use both smartly, depending on signal quality, traffic type, and device capability.

> 🚀 Efficient data handling = Faster Wi-Fi + Fewer errors!

# 💡 CAM (Constantly Awake Mode) in Wi-Fi

## 🔍 What is CAM?

**CAM** stands for **Constantly Awake Mode**. It is the **default power mode** in Wi-Fi where the device's radio is **always on** and actively listening for data or signals from the Access Point (AP).

---

## ⚙️ How CAM Works

In CAM:

- The Wi-Fi radio **never sleeps**.
- The device **immediately processes** all incoming and outgoing data.
- There is **no buffering** of data at the AP — the client is always ready.

---

## ✅ Advantages of CAM

| **Benefit**                  | **Explanation**                                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔋 High Power Consumption     | Constantly running the radio drains the battery faster   |
| 🔥 Not Energy Efficient       | Unsuitable for IoT or battery-powered devices            |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

> Imagine a **security guard** (your device) who never sleeps, watching the front door **24/7**.  
> They can react instantly — but they'll be **exhausted** and **consume a lot of energy**!

---

## 🔁 CAM vs Power Save Mode – Quick Comparison

| **Feature**           | **CAM (Constantly Awake Mode)** | **Power Save Mode**               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Radio State**        | Always ON                        | Sleeps when idle                  |
| **Power Usage**        | High                             | Low to Medium                     |
| **Latency**            | Very Low                         | Slight delay (due to wake-ups)    |
| **Best For**           | Video, VoIP, gaming, real-time   | Background apps, IoT, sensors     |

---

## 🔧 When is CAM Used?

- **Laptops and desktops** plugged into power
- **Real-time communication apps** like Zoom or Teams
- **Streaming** or **gaming**
- When **power saving is turned off** in network settings

---

## ✅ Final Summary

- **CAM (Constantly Awake Mode)** keeps the device ready for communication at all times.
- Great for **performance**, not great for **battery life**.
- Choose CAM when **speed and responsiveness** matter more than power savings.

> ⚡ Always awake = always fast, but at a power cost!

# 🔋 Power Management in Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi devices (like phones, laptops, and IoT devices) often run on batteries. To **extend battery life**, Wi-Fi includes smart **power-saving mechanisms**.

---

## 🧠 Why Power Management Matters

- 🪫 Devices are **often idle** between data transmissions.
- ⚡ Wireless radios consume **significant power** when active.
- 💡 Power management allows devices to **sleep intelligently** without losing connectivity.

---

## ⚙️ How Power Management Works in Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi power-saving is based on a **client–AP (Access Point)** relationship.

### 🧱 Key Concepts:

| **Term**             | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sleep Mode**       | Client turns off its radio to save power                                     |
| **Listen Interval**  | Tells the AP how often the client wakes up to check for data                 |
| **Traffic Indication Map (TIM)** | Bitmap in beacon frames that indicates if AP has data for sleeping clients  |
| **Beacon Frame**     | Periodic signal from AP that includes the TIM and other control info         |
| **PS-Poll**          | Power Save Poll — client uses this to request queued data from AP            |

---

## 📶 Power Save Mechanism – Step by Step

1. **Client enters Power Save mode** and informs the AP.
2. AP **buffers data** for that client.
3. Client **wakes up periodically** based on the *Listen Interval*.
4. AP sends a **Beacon** with a TIM indicating buffered data.
5. Client sends a **PS-Poll** or triggers download to receive data.
6. After receiving, the client may **go back to sleep**.

---

## 💡 Types of Wi-Fi Power Saving Techniques

### 1. 💤 Legacy Power Save Mode

- Defined in early Wi-Fi standards.
- Based on **PS-Poll** mechanism and **beacon-based** listening.
- Still widely supported, but **not optimal** for modern use.

---

### 2. 🚀 WMM Power Save (U-APSD)

> **WMM = Wi-Fi Multimedia**  
> **U-APSD = Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery**

- Introduced to support **VoIP** and **real-time multimedia**.
- More **efficient** than legacy methods.
- Client tells AP when it’s ready, and AP **pushes** buffered packets.

---

### 3. 📡 Target Wake Time (TWT) – Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)

- AP and client **negotiate** specific times for communication.
- Great for **IoT devices** and **smart homes**.
- Dramatically reduces **power consumption** by avoiding unnecessary wakeups.

---

| **Latency**         | Higher                      | Lower                         | Lowest (with scheduling)          |
| **Ideal For**       | General devices             | VoIP, multimedia               | IoT, smart sensors, automation    |
| **Mechanism**       | Beacon + PS-Poll            | Client-triggered AP delivery  | Scheduled wake/sleep windows      |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

> Imagine a student (device) who doesn’t stay in the classroom (network) all the time:

- 💤 **Legacy Mode**: They peek into the room every 10 minutes to see if there’s homework.
- 🚪 **WMM PS**: They notify the teacher when they’re ready, and the teacher gives all the homework at once.
- 🕐 **TWT**: They and the teacher agree on *exact times* to meet. No wasted trips!

---

## ✅ Final Summary

- Wi-Fi uses **smart power-saving** to help mobile and IoT devices conserve energy.
- **Legacy**, **WMM Power Save**, and **TWT** are different techniques depending on device needs and Wi-Fi generation.
- Modern devices leverage **TWT** for scheduled, ultra-efficient communication.

> 🔋 Smart Wi-Fi = Fast Internet + Longer Battery Life

## 🔐 Four-Way Handshake (WPA2)

Used for secure key exchange between client and AP.

### Steps:

1. **AP** generates **ANonce** and sends to **station**.
2. **Station** computes **PMK** from SSID + password, generates **SNonce**, and derives **PTK**.
3. **Station** sends **SNonce** to AP.
4. **AP** derives **PTK**, generates **GTK**, and sends GTK to station.
5. **Station** sends **ACK** to confirm.

---

## 🔐 WPA2 Encrypted Connection Process

1. Station sends **probe request** (with supported data rates and capabilities).
2. AP checks compatibility and sends **probe response**.
3. Station sends **authentication request**.
4. AP sends **authentication response**.
5. Station is now *authenticated* but not yet *associated*.
6. Station sends **association request** (includes selected encryption type).
7. AP responds with **association response** (includes status code and AID).
8. If encryption is WPA2/WPA/WEP → **Four-Way Handshake** is performed for secure communication.

---



# 📡 Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) Process

A **Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)** is a Layer 2 device that acts as a bridge between wireless client devices and the wired network (LAN).

It plays a central role in managing communication, association, and data forwarding in wireless networks.

---

## 🔁 Access Point Roles

- **Beacon Broadcasting**: Periodically advertises its presence and capabilities.
- **Authentication & Association Handling**: Manages connection requests from stations.
- **Frame Forwarding**: Routes data between wireless clients and the wired network.
- **Encryption Management**: Initiates and completes secure key handshakes (e.g., WPA2/WPA3).
- **QoS & Buffering**: Supports traffic prioritization and manages buffers (especially for sleeping clients).

---

## 🔄 Wi-Fi AP Process Workflow

### 1. **Beacon Frame Broadcast**

- AP periodically sends **beacon frames** on its operating channel.
- Beacon includes:
  - **SSID**
  - **Channel info**
  - **Supported data rates**
  - **Security capabilities**
  - **QoS and TIM (Traffic Indication Map)**

> 🔔 This is part of **passive scanning**—clients listen to beacons to discover networks.

---

### 2. **Handling Probe Requests (Active Scanning)**

- Client sends a **probe request** (with or without SSID).
- AP responds with a **probe response** containing:
  - Network info
  - Capabilities
  - Encryption methods

---

### 3. **Authentication Request**

- The client sends an **authentication request** to the AP.
- AP replies with an **authentication response** (accept or reject).

> 📌 This is **open system authentication** in most modern networks (pre-shared key authentication handled later via 4-way handshake).

---

### 4. **Association Request/Response**

- Once authenticated, client sends an **association request**:
  - SSID
  - Supported rates
  - Security capabilities
- AP sends an **association response**:
  - Status (success/failure)
  - Association ID (AID)

> ✅ After this, the client is fully associated and allowed to exchange data frames.

---

## 🔐 Optional: WPA2/WPA3 Four-Way Handshake

If encryption is enabled (WPA2/WPA3):

1. **AP sends ANonce** to client.
2. **Client generates PMK/PTK**, sends SNonce.
3. **AP generates PTK**, derives GTK, sends it to client.
4. **Client sends ACK** to complete the handshake.

> 🔑 This step ensures both sides share secure session keys.

---

## 🔁 Frame Forwarding & Data Handling

- Once associated:
  - AP receives **data frames** from clients.
  - Forwards them to:
    - Another wireless client (intra-BSS)
    - Or a wired LAN endpoint (via **DS** – Distribution System)

---

## 💤 Power Save Mode Handling

- AP buffers packets for clients in **sleep mode**.
- AP sets **TIM flag** in beacon to notify pending data.
- Client wakes up and sends **PS-Poll frame** to retrieve data.

---

## 📶 AP Channel Management

- Operates on a fixed or dynamic channel in 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz bands.
- May support:
  - **Channel bonding** (40/80/160 MHz)
  - **DFS** (Dynamic Frequency Selection)
  - **Band Steering** (2.4 → 5GHz steering)

---

## 🧠 Other AP Features

- **QoS Management**: Uses WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) to prioritize traffic.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes clients among neighboring APs (in ESS).
- **Client Isolation**: Prevents client-to-client traffic on the same BSS.
- **Roaming Support**: Coordinates with other APs in ESS for seamless handover.

# 🌐 How a Wireless Access Point (AP) Provides Internet/Data Access

When you connect your phone or laptop to Wi-Fi, you're actually communicating with a **Wireless Access Point (AP)**. But how does that AP give you access to the internet? Let's break it down step by step.

---

## 📡 Step 1: Device Connects to the AP

1. Your device (called a **station** or **STA**) turns on Wi-Fi.
2. It scans for available networks (either **passively** by listening to beacon frames or **actively** by sending probe requests).
3. When you select a network (SSID), your device sends:
   - **Authentication Request**
   - **Association Request**
4. AP responds and **establishes the connection**.

✅ Now your device is connected **to the AP**, but it doesn’t yet have internet access.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: AP Acts as a Bridge or Gateway

Once connected, the AP needs to **bridge your device to the internet**. It does this in one of two roles:

### 1. **Bridge Mode**

- The AP is **just a wireless extension** of a wired router.
- It passes traffic back and forth **without assigning IP addresses**.
- The **router** handles DHCP (assigning IPs) and internet routing.

### 2. **Router Mode (Standalone AP)**

- The AP itself has **routing capability**.
- It performs **DHCP, NAT, DNS**, and **routes traffic** to the internet.

> 📝 Most home routers combine both AP + Router + DHCP Server in one device (like TP-Link, Netgear, etc.).

---

## 🗂️ Step 3: Device Gets an IP Address (DHCP)

To talk on any network, your device needs an **IP address**.

### Here's how it works (automatically via DHCP):

1. Your device sends a **DHCP Discover** message (broadcast).
2. The AP (or router) replies with a **DHCP Offer** (suggesting an IP address).
3. Your device responds with **DHCP Request** (accepting the offer).
4. The AP replies with **DHCP ACK** (confirmation).

> 🎯 Now your device has:
> - IP address (e.g., `192.168.0.101`)
> - Subnet mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
> - Default gateway (the AP/router IP, e.g., `192.168.0.1`)
> - DNS server address

---

## 🌍 Step 4: Device Sends a Request to the Internet

Let’s say you open a browser and go to `www.google.com`.

1. Your device sends a **DNS request** to find Google’s IP.
2. DNS server replies: `www.google.com` → `142.250.182.36`
3. Your device sends a **data packet** to that IP address.
4. The AP/router **receives the packet** and forwards it to your **internet provider (ISP)** via the modem.

---

## 🔄 Step 5: AP Uses NAT (Network Address Translation)

Your AP shares one **public IP address** (from the ISP) among multiple devices.

- It keeps a **mapping table** of who sent what request.
- This process is called **NAT (Network Address Translation)**.
- So when Google replies, the AP knows which internal device (you) to send it to.

> 📦 NAT allows **many private devices** to use **one public IP**.

---

## 🚥 Step 6: Internet Data Comes Back

- The internet server (like Google) replies to your request.
- The AP receives the data, looks up the correct client, and **forwards it to your device over Wi-Fi**.
- This happens **in milliseconds**.

✅ Congratulations! You now have internet access.

# 📡 Adhoc & Wi-Fi P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Operation - Deep Technical Dive

## 🧩 Overview

This guide covers two decentralized wireless communication modes:

* **Adhoc Mode** (aka IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set)
* **Wi-Fi Direct / P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**

We'll explain their concepts, architecture, operation, and differences, with **Wi-Fi P2P** explored in **deep technical detail**.

---

## 🔄 1. Adhoc Mode (IBSS)

### 🧠 Concept

* A wireless network where devices communicate **directly** with each other **without** an Access Point (AP).
* Ideal for **temporary**, **decentralized**, or **mesh** networks.

### 📦 Characteristics

* **No AP needed**: All nodes are equal (peer-to-peer)
* Uses a **shared SSID** and operates in a common channel
* Each station acts as both transmitter and receiver
* Devices must agree on the same **SSID**, **channel**, and optionally **BSSID**

### 🧱 Formation Process

1. One device creates an IBSS with SSID, channel
2. Others scan for the SSID & join by forming IBSS associations
3. All members periodically send **beacon frames**
4. One member takes over **timing synchronization** responsibility

### 📡 Frame Structure Differences

* IBSS uses a special **BSSID** = **random MAC** generated by the initiating station
* Frame addressing differs slightly:

  * **To DS / From DS** = 0 (no distribution system)
  * **Address1 = Destination**, **Address2 = Source**, **Address3 = BSSID**

### 📉 Limitations

* No centralized control (harder QoS, power management)
* Not ideal for large or dynamic networks
* Devices must manually select channels/SSID

---

## 🔁 2. Wi-Fi P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) - In-Depth

### 🧠 Concept

Wi-Fi P2P (802.11 Task Group P) enables devices to form **direct wireless links** with each other, much like Bluetooth, but using full Wi-Fi speed.

Unlike adhoc, **Wi-Fi Direct elects one peer as a temporary AP** (called **P2P Group Owner - GO**) and supports more structured communication.

> 📘 Think of it as "adhoc++" – no infrastructure needed, but retains features like authentication, power save, service discovery, and even IP assignment.

---

## 🏗️ P2P Architecture

### 👥 Entities

* **P2P Device**: A Wi-Fi device supporting Wi-Fi Direct capabilities
* **P2P Group**: Collection of devices connected via Wi-Fi P2P
* **Group Owner (GO)**: Acts like a soft AP
* **Group Client**: Connects to GO, like a station (STA)

### 🕹️ Roles

| Role                 | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P2P GO               | Controls the group; provides beaconing, DHCP (optionally), security |
| P2P Client           | Joins GO; initiates or participates in service discovery            |
| P2P Persistent Group | Saved connection for future reuse                                   |

### 🔌 MAC/PHY Layer Behavior

* Uses standard 802.11 **STA and AP modes**, dynamically created
* Supports **QoS**, **power save**, **encryption (WPA2/WPA3)**
* Wi-Fi Direct still uses **infrastructure-like MAC headers**

---

## 🔍 P2P Group Formation Process

### 🧭 Discovery Phase

1. **Device Discovery**

   * P2P devices send **P2P Probe Requests** (with P2P IE - Information Element)
   * Others reply with **P2P Probe Response**
2. **Capability Exchange**

   * Devices exchange supported roles, intents

### 🏁 Group Formation Phase

1. **GO Negotiation**

   * Devices exchange GO negotiation requests/responses (3-way handshake)
   * GO is chosen based on **GO Intent value** (0-15)
2. **Group Formation**

   * GO creates a P2P Group (acts like AP)
   * Sends **Beacon frames**, **Group Owner IE**, etc.
3. **Authentication & Provisioning**

   * Devices exchange **WPS handshake** (PIN / Push Button Method)
   * Establish WPA2 connection

---

## 🔄 Group Operation Phase

Once connected:

* GO assigns **IP addresses** via DHCP or APIPA
* Devices communicate over standard **IP protocols**
* Optional features:

  * **Service discovery** (UPnP, Bonjour)
  * **Wi-Fi Display / Miracast**
  * **Multicast DNS** for local name resolution

---

## 🧠 Deep Dive: Under-the-Hood

### 📶 Wireless Layer (MAC/PHY)

* GO behaves like a soft AP:

  * Sends **Beacon frames** (P2P IE, SSID="DIRECT-xyz")
  * Accepts **Probe requests**, replies with **Probe responses**
* Clients behave like stations, scanning and associating like in regular Wi-Fi

### 🔒 Security

* WPA2-PSK/WPA3-SAE
* Pairwise keys derived during provisioning
* Optional: GO may enforce group password / PIN input

### ⚡ Power Management

* GO tracks **power save status** of clients
* Implements **Notice of Absence (NoA)**
* Can schedule **client wakeup windows**

### 🌐 IP Layer

Version2:-
# 📶 Ad-Hoc & Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) Operations Explained

---

## 📡 1. Ad-Hoc (IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set)

### 🔍 What is Ad-Hoc Mode?

* **Ad-Hoc Mode** is a type of **wireless communication** setup where devices connect directly to each other **without using an Access Point (AP)**.
* Also called **peer-to-peer wireless** or **IBSS** (Independent Basic Service Set).

### 🧱 Characteristics

* No centralized control (no AP).
* Each device acts as both a **client** and a **router**.
* Suitable for small networks or quick sharing.
* Uses the **SSID** to identify the group.

### 📋 Setup Process

1. Device A creates an Ad-Hoc network (assigns SSID, channel, etc.).
2. Device B scans for available Ad-Hoc networks.
3. Device B joins using the same SSID and channel.
4. Devices communicate **directly over Layer 2 (MAC)**.

### ⚠️ Limitations

* Poor scalability.
* No support for power-saving features.
* Higher collision rate due to lack of coordination.
* Difficult to route data beyond one hop (no mesh natively).

---

## 🤝 2. Wi-Fi Direct (P2P - Peer-to-Peer)

### 🔍 What is Wi-Fi Direct?

* **Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)** is a standard from the **Wi-Fi Alliance** that allows devices to connect **without an AP**, while still supporting advanced features like **WPA2 security**, **service discovery**, and **dynamic group management**.
* Built on top of **IEEE 802.11** standards.

### 🔧 Key Components

* **P2P Device**: Any device that supports Wi-Fi Direct.
* **P2P Group**: A logical grouping of devices connected together.
* **P2P Group Owner (GO)**: A device that acts like a soft AP to manage the group.
* **P2P Client**: A device that joins the group owned by a GO.

### 🛠️ Modes of Operation

* **Group Formation**
* **Persistent Group Reconnection**
* **Autonomous Group Formation**

---

## 🔄 Group Formation Process (Non-Persistent)

### 🧭 Step-by-Step

1. **Device Discovery**

   * Each P2P device broadcasts **probe requests**.
   * Nearby devices respond with **probe responses**.

2. **Negotiation Phase**

   * Devices exchange **GO Intent Values** (0-15).
   * Higher intent becomes **Group Owner (GO)**.
   * If tied, tie-breaker bit is used.

3. **Group Formation**

   * The GO configures the SSID, channel, and security.
   * Sends **Beacon frames** like a real AP.
   * The client performs WPA2 handshake and joins.

4. **Connection Ready**

   * The P2P group now acts like a soft AP + client model.
   * Devices can now communicate, share data, stream, etc.

---

## 🔁 Persistent Group

### 🔐 What is Persistent Mode?

---

> 📘 **Learning Curve Tip:**
> Understanding Wi-Fi Direct requires familiarity with 802.11 frame types, state machines, and device roles (GO vs Client). Use tools like Wireshark in monitor mode to capture real-world P2P packets!

# 📡 Ad-Hoc vs Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) Operation: Deep Dive

---

## 🔸 Overview

Wireless communication without traditional infrastructure (like routers or APs) can happen in two ways:

* **Ad-Hoc Mode** (IBSS)
* **Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)**

---

## 🧱 Ad-Hoc Mode (IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set)

* **Decentralized** network architecture.
* Devices communicate **directly** with each other.
* No AP (Access Point) involved.
* Often used for temporary, small-scale sharing.

### 🔧 Characteristics

* Operates in **infrastructure-less** mode.
* Devices form a **Basic Service Set (BSS)** without a central controller.
* Each station acts as both transmitter and receiver.
* Same SSID is used for identification.
* Typically uses 2.4 GHz band (but can also be 5 GHz).

### 🔄 Communication Process

1. Devices scan for existing Ad-Hoc networks.
2. If found, they join using matching SSID/channel.
3. If not found, a device starts a new IBSS network.
4. All devices use the same channel to exchange frames.

---

## 🔹 Wi-Fi Direct (P2P - Peer-to-Peer)

Wi-Fi Direct is a standard that enables devices to connect **directly** without a traditional AP, yet still use Wi-Fi protocols. Unlike Ad-Hoc, it's more structured.

### 📘 Based On

* Defined in **Wi-Fi Alliance P2P Technical Specification**.
* Uses standard **802.11 MAC/PHY**.
* Often implemented via **wpa\_supplicant** or **nl80211**.

### 🎯 Key Concepts

* **P2P Device**: A Wi-Fi Direct capable device.
* **P2P Group**: A network of P2P devices, one acts as **Group Owner (GO)**.
* **GO (Group Owner)**: Acts like an AP for the P2P group.
* **P2P Client**: Joins a group created by the GO.
* **Persistent Group**: Remembered group configuration for automatic reconnection.

---

## 🧩 P2P Group Formation Phases

### 🔸 1. Device Discovery

* Devices send **P2P Probe Requests** with P2P IE.
* Others respond with **Probe Responses**.

### 🔸 2. GO Negotiation

* Three-way handshake:

  1. **GO Negotiation Request**
  2. **GO Negotiation Response**
  3. **GO Negotiation Confirmation**
* Device with higher intent becomes **Group Owner**.

### 🔸 3. Provisioning Phase

* If WPS is used:

  * Push Button / PIN method to exchange credentials securely.

### 🔸 4. Group Formation

* GO starts beaconing.
* Clients connect like standard STA → AP connection.

### 🌀 Persistent Groups

* Devices store credentials (like SSID, passphrase).
* Future reconnection skips GO negotiation.

### 🔹 Autonomous GO

* A device **preemptively** creates a P2P group.
* Doesn’t require other device to initiate GO negotiation.

---

## 📦 P2P Information Elements (IE) in Wi-Fi Frames

P2P-specific data is embedded in standard Wi-Fi frames (e.g. Beacons, Probe Requests, GO Negotiation frames).

### 🧬 P2P IE Structure

Each P2P IE follows this format:

* **Element ID**: `0xDD` (Vendor Specific)
* **Length**: Total length of this IE
* **OUI**: `50 6F 9A` (Wi-Fi Alliance OUI)
* **OUI Type**: `09` (P2P)
* **P2P Attributes**: Sequence of TLV (Type-Length-Value) blocks

### 📄 Example P2P Attributes

| Type | Attribute Name        | Description                    |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x00 | P2P Capability        | Group/Device capabilities      |
| 0x01 | P2P Device ID         | MAC address of device          |
| 0x02 | Group Owner Intent    | GO score: higher wins          |
| 0x04 | Configuration Timeout | Timeout during connection      |
| 0x06 | P2P Group ID          | SSID + Device Address          |
| 0x0D | Channel List          | Supported channels/frequencies |
| 0x0E | Notice of Absence     | Power saving scheduling        |
| 0x0F | Device Info           | Manufacturer, device name, etc |

### 📘 Used In Frames:

* Probe Request/Response
* GO Negotiation Request/Response/Confirm
* Association Request
* Beacon (for GO)

### 🧠 Notes:

* Devices parse P2P IE to evaluate capabilities of peers.
* Helps determine channel, WPS method, intent score, etc.
* `Group Owner Intent` plays a major role in deciding who becomes GO.

| **EAP**       | Extensible Authentication Protocol — supports secure authentication like EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA |
| **AAA**       | Authentication, Authorization, Accounting — back-end service, often RADIUS                          |
| **NAI Realm** | Network Access Identifier — identifies home service provider                                        |
| **HESSID**    | Homogeneous Extended Service Set ID — like BSSID, used to identify network groups                   |

### 📡 Operational Flow

1. **Discovery Phase**

   * Client sends Probe Request
   * AP responds with **ANQP Response** containing:

     * Supported Roaming Consortium
     * Venue Name
     * Network Type (e.g., free, commercial)
     * NAI Realms
     * IP Capability
     * WAN Metrics

2. **Authentication**

   * If client has credentials for roaming consortium, it connects using EAP (e.g., EAP-SIM/TTLS/AKA)

3. **Provisioning (if no credentials)**

   * Client connects to **OSU SSID**
   * HTTPS used to securely download a profile
   * Device stores credentials for future use

4. **Roaming**

   * Once provisioned, user can roam between providers using same identity (SIM, certificate, username)

### 📦 Hotspot 2.0 Information Elements

| IE Name                 | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interworking IE         | Advertises network type, access (emergency, chargeable, etc.) |
| Roaming Consortium IE   | Lists OI (Organization Identifiers) for partner networks      |
| HESSID                  | Identifies the extended network group (like cellular PLMN)    |
| WAN Metrics IE          | Indicates network bandwidth, load, etc.                       |

| Connection Capability   | Lists accessible TCP/UDP ports                                |

### 🔧 Backend RADIUS + EAP (TTLS / SIM / AKA)

When the client decides to authenticate, the access point forwards the authentication to a **RADIUS server**, which handles AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).

#### 🔐 EAP-TTLS Flow (Username + Password)

1. Client sends EAP-Request to AP
2. AP forwards to RADIUS server
3. RADIUS and client set up TLS tunnel
4. Inside the tunnel, user credentials are validated
5. If valid, server sends EAP-Success
6. Session keys are derived → 802.11 association completed

#### 📱 EAP-SIM / EAP-AKA (SIM-Based Auth)

* Used in mobile devices (smartphones, tablets)
* SIM card generates authentication tokens
* RADIUS server forwards to **Mobile Core** or **HSS/HLR** to validate SIM
* Enables **seamless roaming** just like LTE/5G

#### 🔐 Certificates (EAP-TLS)

* Uses X.509 certificates on both client and server
* Strongest security, but provisioning is harder

### 🧪 Real Frame Exchange

* **Client sends:** Probe Request (with Hotspot 2.0 capability)
* **AP replies with:** Probe Response + ANQP advertisement
* **Client issues:** ANQP Query (NAI Realm, Roaming Consortium, etc.)
* **AP sends:** ANQP Response
* **Client decides:** Whether to authenticate or use OSU provisioning
* **Authentication:** EAP-based (handled via RADIUS)

### 🧪 Real-World Tools

* `hostapd` with Hotspot 2.0 config
* `wpa_supplicant` with Passpoint credentials
* `wireshark` filters: `anqp`, `hs20`, `eap`
* Supported in Android (>=4.4), iOS (>=7), Windows 10+

### 🆚 Regular AP vs Passpoint AP

# 📡 Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) and Advanced Wi-Fi Operation

---

## 📘 What is Wi-Fi Aware (NAN - Neighbor Awareness Networking)?

* **Wi-Fi Aware** is a peer-to-peer discovery and communication protocol based on **IEEE 802.11mc**.
* Enables continuous background discovery without requiring an internet connection or access point.
* Built for **proximity-based services**: file sharing, multiplayer gaming, location-aware apps, etc.
* Unlike Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Aware focuses more on discovery and low-latency communication using a shared aware infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                            | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NAN Master Indication (NMI)** | Indicates which peer acts as the synchronization anchor               |
| **Service Hash**                | Unique hash that represents a service being advertised                |
| **Discovery Window**            | Time interval when nodes wake up to listen or transmit                |
| **Publish / Subscribe**         | Core paradigm — advertise (publish) or listen (subscribe) to services |
| **SDF / FSD / USF**             | Types of Service Discovery Frames: Solicited/Unsolicited              |
| **NAN Cluster**                 | Group of devices synchronized via a Master Election protocol          |
| **Synchronization Beacon**      | Broadcast by master to maintain time sync across cluster              |

---

## 🔄 Operational Workflow

### 1. **Cluster Formation (Discovery and Sync Phase)**

* Devices start by scanning for **NAN beacons**.
* Each device evaluates if a cluster exists; if not, it becomes a **Master**.
* Master sends out **Synchronization Beacons (NAN Sync Beacons)**.
* Other devices sync their clocks and join the cluster as **slaves**.

### 2. **Service Discovery (Publish / Subscribe)**

* **Publish**:

  * Device announces a service (e.g., multiplayer game available).
  * Can be **solicited** (expects a response) or **unsolicited**.

* **Subscribe**:

  * Another device listens for service hash that matches.
  * If match is found, a response is sent.

* Discovery uses **NAN SDF frames** with TLVs (Type-Length-Value):

  * Service Hash
  * Service Info
  * Match Filter

### 3. **Secure Data Path Setup (NAN Data Path - NDP)**

* After discovery:

  * Devices exchange **NDP Setup Request / Response**
  * Negotiate channel, security (e.g., PMKID, MAC addresses)
  * Establish a **direct peer-to-peer data path** using Wi-Fi

* Uses **NDI (NAN Data Interface)** to send traffic outside of traditional IP stack

---

## 🧬 Wi-Fi Aware Frame Types

| Frame Type                        | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sync Beacon**                   | Sent by master — includes timing, cluster ID                 |
| **Sync + Discovery**              | Combined frame for synchronization and service advertisement |
| **SDF (Service Discovery Frame)** | Carries service name, match filter, etc.                     |
| **NDP Setup Req/Resp**            | Used to initiate and confirm data path setup                 |
| **NDPE**                          | Encapsulation for sending user data over NDP                 |

---

## 🔒 Security

* NAN itself is discovery focused, but for NDP:

  * Encryption is possible with **PMK (Pairwise Master Key)** or **PMKID**
  * Some implementations rely on Wi-Fi Protected Management Frames
  * Identity protection is minimal by default — security is app-layer driven

---

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

* Defines **Access Categories (ACs)**:

  * **AC\_VO**: Voice
  * **AC\_VI**: Video
  * **AC\_BE**: Best Effort
  * **AC\_BK**: Background

Each AC has its own **Contention Window (CW)** and **Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS)**:

* Voice gets smallest CW and AIFS → prioritized
* Background gets largest → deprioritized

### ⚙️ WMM Parameters Table

| AC | CWmin | CWmax | AIFS | TXOP Limit |
| -- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| VO | 3     | 7     | 2    | 1.504 ms   |

## 🔬 OFDMA Scheduling Internals (802.11ax)

### 🧠 Concept

OFDMA = Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access. Introduced in Wi-Fi 6 to allow **multiple clients to share a single channel simultaneously**.

### 📐 Resource Units (RUs)

* Channel is divided into **Resource Units** (RUs)
* AP assigns RUs to clients

  * Smallest RU = 26-tone
  * Largest RU = 996-tone (entire 80 MHz channel)

### 🗂️ Scheduler Logic

The AP’s MAC layer scheduler dynamically:

* Monitors **Buffer Status Reports (BSR)**
* Accounts for **QoS** levels (voice, video, etc.)
* Uses **Channel State Information (CSI)** to optimize throughput
* Sends **Trigger Frames** to initiate uplink OFDMA

### 🧱 OFDMA Downlink Frame Structure

* Preamble

  * Common + User-specific
* Data: RUs interleaved for different clients

### 📶 Trigger-Based Uplink

1. AP sends **Trigger Frame**
2. STAs respond with **OFDMA-scheduled data** on assigned RUs
3. Enables synchronized, low-latency access

### 🛠️ Benefits

* Spectral efficiency
* Reduced latency
* Scalable IoT performance

---

## 🎯 TSPEC Negotiation (WMM Admission Control)

### 🔁 Process

### 🧾 TSPEC IE Fields

* **Traffic Type** (e.g., Voice)
* **Nominal MSDU Size**
* **Mean Data Rate**
* **Minimum PHY Rate**
* **Delay Bound**
* **Surplus Bandwidth Allowance**

### ⚖️ Admission Control Decision

* AP uses **ACM (Admission Control Mandatory)** flags
* Checks **available bandwidth** and **QoS policy**
* May reject if traffic cannot be guaranteed

### 🧪 Use Case: Voice over Wi-Fi

* Voice STA uses AC\_VO
* Sends ADDTS for \~64 Kbps traffic
* Low delay bound (e.g., < 50ms)

### 🔍 Frame View (Wireshark)

* Frame Type: Action
* Category: QoS
* Element ID: TSPEC (221)

# 🚀 Final Deep Dive: Target Wake Time (TWT) & IEEE 802.11p

---

## ⏰ Target Wake Time (TWT) — Wi-Fi 6 / 6E / 7 Power Optimization

### 📘 What is TWT?

TWT (Target Wake Time) is a power-saving mechanism introduced in **IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**. It allows devices (STAs) to **negotiate specific times** with the Access Point (AP) to wake up for transmissions.

This reduces the time the radio stays awake — critical for **IoT, wearables, mobile clients**, and **dense network** scenarios.

---

### ⚙️ How TWT Works

#### 🧩 Types of TWT Agreements

* **Individual TWT**: Specific to a client (STA and AP negotiate directly)
* **Broadcast TWT**: AP schedules a group of STAs to wake at the same time

#### 🗂️ Key Parameters in a TWT Agreement

* **TWT Wake Interval**: How often to wake (in TU — Time Units)
* **TWT Duration**: How long to stay awake after waking
* **TWT Target Time**: Exact wake-up moment (relative to Beacon time)
* **TWT Flow Identifier**: Identifies TWT sessions

---

### 🔄 TWT Negotiation Process

1. **TWT Request Frame** (from STA)
2. **TWT Response Frame** (from AP): Accept/Decline + parameters
3. STA configures its sleep/wake schedule

#### 💡 Implementation Insights

* TWT IE (Information Element) is embedded in **Action Frames**
* Uses **Management Action Frame Category: QoS Management**
* Bit fields indicate negotiation type (Request, Accept, Teardown, etc.)

---

### 📉 Benefits of TWT

* 💤 **Power Efficiency**: Clients sleep for longer intervals
* 📶 **Reduced Contention**: Predictable wake-ups lower airtime contention
* 🔋 **Battery Gains**: Especially for Wi-Fi 6 IoT devices

## 🚘 IEEE 802.11p — Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE)

### 📘 Overview

802.11p is designed for **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)** and **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)** communication — enabling **DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Communication)**.

Primarily operates in **5.9 GHz band** with 10 MHz channel widths for reduced delay.

---

### 🚗 Use Cases

* Collision avoidance
* Traffic signal alerts
* Emergency vehicle priority
* Platooning & Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)

---

### ⚙️ PHY/MAC Differences (from 802.11a)

* **OFDM-based** like 802.11a
* **10 MHz channel bandwidth** (vs 20 MHz in 802.11a)
* **No association process** — "connectionless mode"
* **Wildcard BSSID** used (since no AP association)
* **No encryption/authentication** in base spec (safety prioritized over security)

---

### 🔄 Frame Exchange in 802.11p

* Data exchange starts directly using wildcard BSSID
* Beaconing still used for service announcements
* Uses **WAVE Service Advertisements (WSA)** to indicate app-level services

---

### 🧪 Performance Aspects

* Lower PHY rate than 11a (due to 10 MHz)
* Highly tolerant to delay, Doppler shifts
* Designed for **high-mobility scenarios** (>100 km/h)

---

### 🔐 Security Extensions

802.11p alone doesn't define security — usually coupled with:

* **IEEE 1609.2** (security for vehicular messages)
* **PKI-based certificates** for trusted messages

---

### 🛠️ Simulation/Testing Tools

* **NS-3** with `wave` module
* **OMNeT++** + Veins + SUMO for mobility
* Wireshark with DSRC support (some experimental patches)
