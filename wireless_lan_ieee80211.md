# 🌐 Wireless LAN and IEEE 802.11 Overview

## 🔧 What is Wireless LAN?

A **Wireless LAN** is a network where devices communicate using wireless protocols/technologies within a defined area.

---

## 📜 What is IEEE 802.11 ?

the IEEE 802.11 standard defines how Wireless LANs operate. It provides a common framework that governs how data is transmitted, accessed, and secured over the air.

The standard specifically addresses two key layers of the OSI model, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **Physical Layer** :-Transmission/reception and modulation/demodulation of raw bits/signal over the wireless medium
- **Data Link Layer**:-Ensures reliable data delivery/access over the physical medium

---

## 📶 Wireless Services in IEEE 802.11
The IEEE 802.11 standard defines two main types of service structures that organize how wireless networks operate:
## 1. **BSS (Basic Service Set)**

- A group/unit of wireless network devices communicating with the same **Access Point (AP)**.

### 2. **ESS (Extended Service Set)**

- A collection of multiple APs and their associated client stations, all united by a single **Distribution System Medium (DSM)**.
- The **ESSID** (Extended SSID) is the shared network name.
- The terms **SSID** and **ESSID** are often used interchangeably.

---

## 📡 Key Terms

- **BSSID**: The physical /MAC address of the AP (48-bit hex).
- **AP (Access Point)**:these are devices which accept Wireless signals from multiple devices and retransmit them to  the rest of the network.
  - Acts as a bridge between wireless devices and the wired network.
  - Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
- **SSID**: A unique string identifying a wireless network.

# 📡 Wireless Network Modes

Wireless network interface cards (NICs) can operate in several modes, each designed for specific purposes. Below are the common Wi-Fi modes:

## **1. Infrastructure Mode**
- **Most common mode** used in Wi-Fi networks.
- Devices (stations) communicate through a central **Access Point (AP)**.
- AP manages traffic and facilitates communication between devices and external networks (e.g., internet).

## **2. Ad-Hoc Mode (IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set)**
- Peer-to-peer communication **without** an Access Point.
- Devices connect directly in a **decentralized** network.
- Suitable for small or temporary networks.

## **3. Monitor Mode (Promiscuous Mode)**
- NIC listens to all wireless frames in the air, even if not addressed to it.
- Used for:
  - Packet sniffing
  - Wireless troubleshooting
  - Network analysis and security auditing
- Unlike promiscuous mode in Ethernet, monitor mode works at the radio level.

## **4. Master Mode**
- Typically used by **Access Points**.
- The device acts as a central controller allowing other devices (clients) to connect.

## **5. Repeater Mode**
- Extends the range of an existing wireless network.
- Receives signal from an AP and rebroadcasts it.

## **6. Bridge Mode**
- Connects two different network segments, often wired and wireless.
- Used to link two LANs using wireless communication.

## **7. Mesh Mode**
- Devices (nodes) act as both clients and routers.
- Creates a **self-healing, self-configuring** wireless network.
- Common in large area deployments like campuses or smart cities.

## **8. Client Mode**
- Standard mode where a device (e.g., laptop, phone) connects to an AP to access the network.

# 🧩 Data Link Layer Details

The **Data Link Layer** in the OSI model ensures reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes. It is divided into two sublayers:

## **Two Sublayers**

### 1. Logical Link Control (LLC)
- Provides an interface between the network layer and MAC sublayer.
- Responsible for:
  - Frame synchronization
  - Flow control
  - Error checking

### 2. Medium Access Control (MAC)
- Controls access to the physical transmission medium.
- Responsible for:
  - Addressing (MAC addresses)
  - Channel access control
  - Frame delimiting and error detection

---
## 🕹️ MAC Layer Functions:-
In Mac we have two more layers
### 1. **DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)**

- it provides contention Based Services i.e it uses **CSMA/CA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance).
- Operates on **half-duplex**.
- **csma\ca Timers** are used to avoid collisions.

> 📌 *CSMA/CA is for wireless, CSMA/CD is for wired.*

### 2. **PCF (Point Coordination Function)**

- Poll-based / priority-based access mechanism.

---

# 📡 CSMA/CA in Wi-Fi: Problems Explained

## 🧠 What is CSMA/CA?

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)** is a network protocol used in **Wi-Fi** to manage how multiple devices share the same wireless channel.

> 💡 It tries to **avoid** collisions *before* they happen, unlike CSMA/CD (used in Ethernet), which handles collisions *after* they occur.

---

## ⚙️ How CSMA/CA Works (Simplified)

1. A device **"listens"** to check if the wireless channel is free.
2. If the channel is **idle**, it waits for a short, random time.
3. If still idle, it **sends** the data.
4. If the channel is **busy**, the device waits and tries again later.

---

## ❗ Common Problems with CSMA/CA in Wi-Fi

### 1. 🔇 Hidden Node Problem

#### 📍 What happens:
- Two devices (A and C) are **out of range** of each other but **both in range** of the same Access Point (B).
- A and C **can’t hear** each other.
- Both think the channel is free and **transmit at the same time** → causing a **collision** at B.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Station A
    participant B as Access Point (AP)
    participant C as Station C

    Note over A,C: A and C are out of range of each other\n(but both can reach AP B)

    A->>B: 📡 Transmit Data
    Note over A,C: C does not sense A's transmission
    C->>B: 📡 Transmit Data (simultaneously)

    Note over B: ❌ Collision occurs at AP B

    Note over A,C: A and C are unaware of the collision

    B-->>A: ⚠️ No ACK (due to collision)
    B-->>C: ⚠️ No ACK (due to collision)

    Note over A,C: Both A and C must retransmit later
```
#### 📌 Real-World Analogy:
> Imagine two people in separate rooms trying to talk to the same receptionist over a walkie-talkie. They can’t hear each other and both talk at once, confusing the receptionist.

---

### 2. 📡 Exposed Node Problem

#### 📍 What happens:
- A device refrains from transmitting, thinking the channel is busy, even when its transmission **would not cause interference**.

#### 📌 Example:
- Device A is sending data to B.
- Device C wants to send data to D.
- C hears A's signal and assumes the channel is busy.
- But since C → D and A → B are **non-interfering**, it could have transmitted safely.

#### ❌ Result:
- **Unnecessary waiting** → **inefficient use** of the wireless channel.

---

### 3. 🐢 High Overhead from Waiting

- Due to **random backoff timers** and **acknowledgments**, there is a delay even when the network is idle.
- Leads to **reduced throughput**, especially with many devices.

---

### 4. 📶 Performance Drops with More Devices

- As more devices share the channel, the chances of collisions and delays increase.
- **Congestion** leads to **packet loss**, **retransmissions**, and **slower speeds**.

---

### 5. 🔁 No Central Control

- Wi-Fi uses a **distributed system**, so each device independently decides when to transmit.
- This can lead to **poor coordination**, especially in crowded networks.

## 🌐 Final Thought

CSMA/CA is **essential** for wireless networking, but it comes with **challenges**, especially in **crowded** or **large** networks. Understanding these problems helps in designing **better Wi-Fi** systems and troubleshooting **connectivity issues**.

### 🚦 OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)

- **What it is**: An enhancement of OFDM (used in previous Wi-Fi standards) that allows multiple users to transmit data **simultaneously** by dividing a channel into smaller sub-channels called **Resource Units (RUs)**.
  
- **How it works**:
  - The available bandwidth (e.g., 20/40/80 MHz) is divided into smaller frequency tones (subcarriers).
  - Each user is assigned a group of these subcarriers (RUs), allowing multiple users to share the channel **at the same time** instead of waiting their turn.
### 👥 MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output)

- **What it is**: A method that allows a wireless access point to transmit **different data streams to multiple devices simultaneously**, using multiple antennas.

- **How it works**:
  - The AP has multiple antennas that can focus signals (beamforming) and serve several clients **at once** instead of one at a time.
  - Previously, MU-MIMO worked only for **downlink**; 802.11ax introduces **uplink MU-MIMO** as well.
### 🔄 Downlink vs Uplink MU-MIMO

**MU-MIMO (Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output)** allows multiple devices to communicate with an access point (AP) at the same time, using multiple antennas. This can happen in two directions:

---

#### 📤 Uplink MU-MIMO

- **What it is**: Multiple client devices **simultaneously send data** to the access point.
- **Introduced in**: **802.11ax** (Wi-Fi 6)
- **Example**: Several smartphones uploading photos to the cloud at the same time.
- **Benefit**: Reduces congestion and wait time when many devices are transmitting data to the AP.

---

#### 📥 Downlink MU-MIMO

- **What it is**: The access point **simultaneously sends different data streams** to multiple devices.
- **Introduced in**: **802.11ac Wave 2** (downlink only), enhanced in **802.11ax**
- **Example**: Streaming different videos to a tablet, a laptop, and a smart TV — all at once.
- **Benefit**: Increases download efficiency and overall throughput.

---

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Direction     | Introduced In | Who Sends Data | Who Receives Data | Real-Life Example                            |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Downlink**  | 802.11ac (Wave 2) | Access Point   | Multiple Devices   | Watching YouTube on multiple devices         |
| **Uplink**    | 802.11ax          | Multiple Devices | Access Point       | Uploading files to Google Drive from phones  |

## 🔍 Scanning and Association

### What is Scanning?

The process by which a station discovers available wireless networks(AP) before associating with an AP.

### Scanning Steps:

1. Station sends a **probe request frame**.
2. Nearby APs respond with **probe response frames**.
3. Station sends an **association request** to the chosen AP.
4. AP sends back an **association response**.

### Scanning Types:

- **Active Scanning**: Station sends probe request → AP responds.
- **Passive Scanning**: APs periodically send **beacon frames**( advertising packets illustrating its capability to all stations).

---
## 🔐 Open (No Encryption) Connection Process

1. AP sends **beacon frame** (broadcast).
2. Client sends **probe request** with SSID.
3. AP replies with **probe response**.
4. Client sends **authentication request**.
5. AP sends **authentication response**.
6. Client sends **association request**.
7. AP sends **association response**.
8. Client may later send **disconnect frame**.

## 🔐 WPA2 Encrypted Connection Process

The process of establishing a secure WPA2 connection between a **client station (STA)** and an **Access Point (AP)** involves several key steps:

1. **🔎 Probe Request**
   - The **station** sends a **probe request** to discover nearby APs.
   - It includes supported data rates, security capabilities, and SSID (if known).

2. **📡 Probe Response**
   - The **AP** responds with a **probe response** containing its capabilities and supported configurations.

3. **🛂 Authentication Request**
   - The **station** sends an **authentication request** to the AP (Open System Authentication is used in WPA2).

4. **🛡️ Authentication Response**
   - The **AP** sends back an **authentication response**, typically approving the request.
   - At this stage, the station is **authenticated but not yet associated**.

5. **🔗 Association Request**
   - The **station** sends an **association request** to the AP.
   - This includes supported features and the **encryption type** (e.g., WPA2 with AES).

6. **📶 Association Response**
   - The **AP** sends an **association response** containing a **status code** and an **Association ID (AID)**.

7. **🔐 Four-Way Handshake (if WPA2/WPA/WEP)**
   - If encryption is enabled (WPA2/WPA/WEP), the AP and station perform a **Four-Way Handshake** to:
     - Confirm mutual possession of the **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**
     - Derive **session keys** for encryption (PTK & GTK)
     - Ensure secure communication is established

---

### ✅ Summary
Once the Four-Way Handshake is complete, the station is **fully connected and encrypted** using WPA2, and can securely send and receive data over the wireless network.



---
## 🔐 Four-Way Handshake (WPA2)

Used for secure key exchange between client and AP.

### Steps:

1. **AP** generates **ANonce** and sends to **station**.
2. **Station** computes **PMK**(Pairwise Master Key)  from SSID + password, generates **SNonce**, and derives **PTK**.
3. **Station** sends **SNonce** to AP.
4. **AP** derives **PTK**, generates **GTK**, and sends GTK to station.
5. **Station** sends **ACK** to confirm.

### 📝 Quick Definitions:
- **Security Protocol**: Overall system that defines how Wi-Fi is secured.
- **Encryption Algorithm**: Technique used to encrypt and ensure data integrity.
- **Authentication Method**: How users/devices prove their identity.

## 🔐 WPA3 Encrypted Connection Process (with SAE)

In **WPA3-Personal**, the connection process enhances security by replacing the traditional **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)** mechanism with **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**. SAE provides forward secrecy and robust protection against offline dictionary attacks.

Below is a step-by-step overview of how a WPA3 connection is established:

---

### 1. 🔎 **Probe Request**
- The **station (STA)** broadcasts a **probe request** to discover nearby access points (APs).
- This request includes the SSID (optionally) and the station's supported security capabilities.

---

### 2. 📡 **Probe Response**
- The **access point (AP)** replies with a **probe response**.
- It advertises its capabilities, including support for WPA3 and SAE.

---

### 3. 🤝 **SAE Handshake (Authentication)**
- The traditional open-system authentication used in WPA2 is replaced by **SAE**, a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE).
- SAE performs a secure **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** using the shared password:
  - Both the STA and the AP generate cryptographic elements derived from the password.
  - They exchange **commit messages** (containing public values) and **confirm messages** to verify authenticity.
  - Both sides independently derive the same **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**.
- Key Features:
  - **Mutual authentication** is achieved without revealing the password.
  - Resistant to **offline dictionary attacks** and **passive eavesdropping**.
- Upon successful SAE handshake, the **station is authenticated**.

---

### 4. 🔗 **Association Request**
- The **station** sends an **association request** to the AP, expressing intent to join the network.
- This message includes supported features and confirms WPA3 capabilities.

---

### 5. 📶 **Association Response**
- The **access point** replies with an **association response**.
- If successful, it assigns an **Association ID (AID)** to the station, completing the association phase.

---

### 6. 🔐 **Four-Way Handshake**
- As in WPA2, WPA3 uses the **Four-Way Handshake** to derive session keys and ensure key confirmation.
- The difference: WPA3 uses the **PMK derived from the SAE handshake** instead of a PSK.
- Steps:
  1. The AP sends a **nonce (ANonce)** to the station.
  2. The station replies with its **nonce (SNonce)**, computes the **Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)**, and includes a MIC (Message Integrity Code).
  3. The AP derives the PTK, verifies the MIC, and sends the **Group Temporal Key (GTK)** encrypted using the PTK.
  4. The station confirms receipt and key installation.

- Outcome:
  - Both parties confirm possession of matching keys.
  - The connection is now fully encrypted with **unique session keys**.

---

✅ **Conclusion**:
WPA3 with SAE significantly improves Wi-Fi security by eliminating vulnerabilities in WPA2's PSK model. It ensures robust authentication, forward secrecy, and resistance to offline attacks while maintaining interoperability with familiar connection procedures.

```
### ✅ Summary
Once the SAE handshake and Four-Way Handshake are completed:
- The **station is securely authenticated**.
- All data transmission is **encrypted using AES (CCMP or GCMP)**.
- The connection offers **forward secrecy** and stronger protection against brute-force attacks.

## 🏢 WPA2-Enterprise Connection Process (with EAP-TLS / PEAP)

**WPA2-Enterprise** uses **802.1X authentication** and the **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** to provide **strong, centralized, and certificate-based security**, ideal for enterprise environments.

The process differs from WPA2-Personal, as it involves a **RADIUS server** and may use **client/server certificates** depending on the EAP method.

---

### 🔁 Shared Steps (WPA2-Enterprise with EAP)

1. **🔎 Probe Request / Response**
   - The **station (STA)** sends a **probe request** to discover nearby APs.
   - The **AP** replies with its supported capabilities.

2. **🛂 Open System Authentication**
   - A basic **open authentication exchange** occurs (not actual security auth).
   - STA is now authenticated at Layer 2 but not yet authorized to access the network.

3. **🔗 Association Request / Response**
   - The STA sends an **association request** to the AP, signaling intent to join the network.
   - The AP responds with an **association response**, assigning an AID.

4. **🧠 802.1X Authentication Begins**
   - The AP acts as a **relay** between the STA and the **RADIUS server**.
   - The **EAP authentication method** is negotiated (e.g., EAP-TLS or PEAP).

---

### 🔐 EAP-TLS (Certificate-Based)

- **Mutual certificate-based authentication**:
  - The **RADIUS server presents its certificate** to the client.
  - The **client also presents a certificate** to the server.
- **TLS handshake** establishes a **secure tunnel**.
- A **master session key (MSK)** is derived and securely shared with the AP.
- Requires:
  - **Client certificate**
  - **Server certificate**
- **Security**: Very high, with mutual authentication and no passwords.

---

### 🔐 PEAP (Password + TLS Tunnel)

- **Protected EAP (PEAP)** creates a secure TLS tunnel between the client and server.
- Only the **server presents a certificate** (client does not).
- After the tunnel is established:
  - The client authenticates using **username/password** (e.g., MSCHAPv2).
- Easier to manage (no client certs), but:
  - Slightly **less secure** than EAP-TLS.
  - Still strong when configured properly.

### 🔄 4-Way Handshake

- Once EAP authentication succeeds:
  - Both parties derive a shared **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**.
  - The AP and station perform the **Four-Way Handshake**:
    - Derive **PTK** (Pairwise Transient Key)
    - Exchange **GTK** (Group Temporal Key)
    - Finalize encryption setup

---

### ✅ Summary

After successful EAP authentication and the 4-Way Handshake:
- The client is **securely authenticated**.
- **Encrypted communication** is enabled using AES (CCMP).
- Centralized identity and access management is enforced via the **RADIUS server**.

## 📡 What is EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN)?

**EAPOL** is the protocol used to transport **EAP messages** between the **station (client)** and the **Access Point (AP)** in **802.1X-based authentication**, including EAP-TLS and PEAP.

- Defined by: **IEEE 802.1X**
- Runs at: **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
- Used in: **Both wired and wireless networks**

---

### 📥 Where is EAPOL Used in the WPA2-Enterprise (EAP-TLS/PEAP) Process?

Here's how it fits into the authentication sequence:

1. **Station connects to the AP** via association request/response (standard Wi-Fi process).
2. **802.1X authentication begins.**
   - AP sends an **EAP-Request/Identity** frame to the station using **EAPOL**.
   - Station responds with **EAPOL-Response/Identity**.
3. All subsequent **EAP-TLS or PEAP messages** (certificates, credentials, etc.) are exchanged over **EAPOL** between the station and AP.
   - The AP **relays EAPOL messages** to/from the **RADIUS server** using **RADIUS over UDP**.

---

### 🔐 Transition to 4-Way Handshake

- Once the **EAP-TLS handshake is complete**, a **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)** is derived.
- Then, the **4-Way Handshake** begins, which is also carried over **EAPOL frames**:
  - These include key confirmation, PTK/GTK derivation, and key installation.

---

### ✅ Summary Table

| Stage                        | Protocol Used | Transport Medium      |
|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| EAP Identity Exchange        | EAPOL         | Between STA and AP     |
| EAP-TLS / PEAP Auth Process  | EAP over EAPOL| STA ↔ AP ↔ RADIUS Server|
| 4-Way Handshake (Key Exchange)| EAPOL-Key     | STA ↔ AP               |

---

### 📝 Key Points
- **EAPOL** is not an EAP method itself; it’s the **carrier** for EAP messages in 802.1X.
- It’s used in **both authentication and key exchange** phases of WPA2-Enterprise.
- **EAPOL-Key frames** are used specifically in the **4-Way Handshake** after authentication succeeds.



## 🌍 Layer 3 – DHCP Process + Network Info

After a successful Layer 2 (Wi-Fi) connection, your device begins the **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** process to obtain Layer 3 network configuration.

---

### 🔁 DHCP Exchange & Network Info

| **DHCP Step**         | **Who Sends It**         | **Message Type**       | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. DHCP Discover**  | 📱 Your device             | 🔊 Broadcast            | "Is there a DHCP server? I need an IP address!"                            |

| **DNS Server**          | `8.8.8.8` or router IP    | 📩 DHCP Offer & ACK      | Resolves domain names like `google.com` to IP addresses  |

---

### ✅ Final Summary

- DHCP is part of the **Layer 3 setup** after the device joins Wi-Fi at Layer 2.
- It gives your device everything it needs to **communicate beyond the local network**.
- Without DHCP, you'd need to configure all these values **manually** (static IP).

> 🧠 DHCP is the bridge between being connected to Wi-Fi and actually accessing the internet.

> 🧪 This field defines the **type, control, and behavior** of the 802.11 frame.

## 🧾 IEEE 802.11 Frame Types and Subtypes

Each 802.11 frame has a **Frame Type** field (2 bits) and a **Subtype** field (4 bits) inside the **Frame Control (FC)** field.
These determine **what kind of frame it is** and **what it's used for**.
### Frame Types:
Frame type is subdivided into
1. **Management Frames**
2. **Control Frames**
3. **Data Frames**

Sub type helps specify the exact frametype(Probe,RTS etc..)

---

### 📊 Frame Types & Subtypes Table

| **Frame Type**       | **Type Value** | **Common Subtypes**                          | **Usage**                                         |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Management**       | `00`           | - Association Request<br>- Association Response<br>- Probe Request<br>- Probe Response<br>- Beacon<br>- Authentication<br>- Deauthentication | Used to **establish, manage, and terminate** Wi-Fi connections |
| **Control**          | `01`           | - RTS (Request to Send)<br>- CTS (Clear to Send)<br>- ACK (Acknowledgment)<br>- PS-Poll | Assists with **medium access control**, power saving, and reliability |

| **Reserved**         | `11`           | - N/A                                          | Reserved for future use by IEEE                  |

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- The **Frame Type** tells us the category (Mgmt, Control, Data).
- The **Subtype** field (4 bits) tells us **exactly what kind of frame** it is within that category.
- These values are found inside the **Frame Control field** of every 802.11 frame.

> 🔍 Example:  
> A **Beacon Frame** has Frame Type = `00` (Management), Subtype = `1000` (Beacon)

---


### Other Fields:

- **Duration**: The duration bit specify  time interval we want to occupy the channel.
- **Sequence Control (SC)**: Used for Synchronization
- **FCS**: Frame Check Sequence is used for are checking probably (CRC32)

| Addr4   | Original Source (if needed)    |

> 🔹 If `To DS = 0` and `From DS = 0` → Direct station-to-station communication.

**More frag** (More fragments): It is 1 bit long field which when set to 1 means frame is followed by other fragments.
**Order**: It is 1 bit long field, if this bit is set to 1 the received frames must be processed in strict order.
**retry**:it is 1-bit long field, if the current frame is a retransmission of an earlier frame.
**power mgmt**:If the field is set to 1, station goes into power-save mode. If the field is set to 0, the station stays active.

## 📡 Beacon Frames in Wi-Fi

Beacon frames are **broadcast management frames** sent periodically by Access Points (APs) to announce the presence of a Wi-Fi network.

---

### 🧭 Purpose of Beacon Frames

| **Function**                   | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Announce the network**      | AP advertises its SSID (network name)                                          |
| **Synchronization**           | Helps client devices sync their internal clocks with the AP's timestamp        |

| **Timestamp**                         | Syncs client clock with AP                                               |
| **Beacon Interval**                   | Interval between beacons (in TUs)                                        |
| **Capability Info**                   | Flags: ESS, Privacy (WEP/WPA), IBSS, etc.                                |
| **SSID**                              | Network name (may be null for hidden networks)                           |
| **Supported Rates**                   | Data rates supported by AP                                               |
| **DS Parameter Set**                  | Includes **current channel** (e.g., 6, 11, etc.)                          |
| **TIM (Traffic Indication Map)**      | Shows if AP has buffered data for sleeping clients                       |

| **Vendor-Specific IEs**               | Optional extensions like 802.11k/v/r, roaming hints, etc.                |

**DS Parameter Set** = Just the channel number — tells clients what RF channel the AP is using.

**QoS Info** is included only if AP supports WMM, and it appears in the WMM Parameter Element inside the optional IEs section of the beacon frame.
Tag: WMM Parameter Element (WME)
  - QoS Info (U-APSD support, queue settings)
  - Access Categories: Voice, Video, Best Effort, Background



### ⏱️ Beacon Interval

- Defined in **time units (TUs)** — 1 TU = **1024 microseconds**
- Default interval: **100 TUs** → ~102.4 ms (approx. 10 beacons/sec)

---

### 📶 Beacon Frame Properties

| **Property**           | **Value**               |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Frame Type/Subtype** | Management / Subtype 8  |
| **Transmission Mode**  | Broadcast (to all clients) |
| **Reliability**        | Not ACKed (unreliable delivery) |
| **Frequency**          | Sent on primary channel only |
| **Encryption**         | Never encrypted         |

---

### 🔍 Real-World Use Cases

- Wi-Fi scanners (e.g., in phones or `Wireshark`) **rely on beacon frames** to detect nearby SSIDs.
- Beacons are **always sent**, even if the SSID is "hidden" (though in that case, SSID field is null).
- Client devices use the **timestamp and interval** to sync their sleep/wake schedules (important for power saving).

---

### ⚠️ Security Note

- Beacon frames **advertise the presence of a network**, so:
  - Hidden SSIDs don't offer real security — they just omit the SSID name
  - Attackers can still detect networks based on beacon frame traffic

---

## ✅ Summary

| **Why Beacons Matter** |
|------------------------|
| 📡 They announce the Wi-Fi network to nearby devices |
| 🕒 Help clients stay synchronized and manage power |
| 🔑 Carry critical info like supported rates, channel, and security |
| 🧭 Clients scan and connect based on beacon frame contents |

> 💡 Without beacon frames, Wi-Fi devices wouldn’t even know which networks exist — they're like digital lighthouses!

## 🚶‍♂️ Fast & Smart Roaming in Wi-Fi: 802.11k / v / r

When you're moving around (like walking with your phone), Wi-Fi clients need to **switch between APs** — this is called **roaming**. Without optimizations, roaming can be slow or result in dropped packets.

### 📦 Purpose of 802.11k/v/r
| **Standard** | **Focus**         | **Goal**                                |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **802.11k**  | Knowledge         | Help clients discover better APs faster |
| **802.11v**  | Direction         | Let APs steer clients toward better APs |
| **802.11r**  | Speed             | Make roaming itself faster (Fast BSS Transition) |

---

## 🔍 802.11k – "Know Before You Roam"

**k = knowledge**

- AP provides a **neighbor report** (a list of nearby APs + their signal strengths, channels, BSSIDs).
- Client uses this to **pre-scan** and decide **where to roam next**.
- Reduces delay because the client **doesn't have to scan every channel** blindly.

### ✨ Example:
- Your phone asks the AP: “Who else is nearby?”
- The AP replies: “Here are 3 APs with good coverage.”

---

## 🧭 802.11v – "You Should Go Now"

**v = direction / suggestion**

- AP can suggest a better AP for the client to connect to.
- Known as **BSS Transition Management**.
- Used in **load balancing**, weak signal detection, or power-saving modes.

### ✨ Example:
- AP says: “Hey client, your signal is weak. Please roam to AP-2 at -55 dBm.”
- The client may **accept or ignore** the suggestion.

---

## ⚡ 802.11r – "Roam Fast (FT)"

**r = rapid roaming**

- Reduces the **authentication delay** when switching APs.
- Implements **Fast BSS Transition (FT)**.
- Pre-shares cryptographic keys (PMK-R0/R1) between APs.
- So when the client switches, it **doesn’t need full WPA2 handshake** again.

### ✨ Example:
- Without 802.11r: Roaming takes 300+ ms → noticeable lag (VoIP, gaming)
- With 802.11r: Roaming in ~50 ms → smooth handoff

| **Best Use Case** | Large campus Wi-Fi   | Mesh / enterprise networks    | VoIP, video calls, low-latency apps  |

---

## ✅ Real World Analogy

> Imagine you're moving between conference rooms in a building with many Wi-Fi hotspots:

- 🧠 **802.11k** gives you a **map** of other nearby access points.
- 🧭 **802.11v** acts like a **guide**, telling you which door to take next.
- ⚡ **802.11r** gives you a **VIP pass**, letting you skip the security line when you arrive.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use These?

- Supported only if **both AP and client device** support these standards.
- Most modern enterprise APs (e.g., Cisco, Aruba, UniFi) support them.
- Most modern phones/laptops support **k/v**, and many also support **r**.
- Configuration is typically done in the **Wi-Fi controller / AP settings**.



# 🔗 Fragmentation & Aggregation in Wi-Fi

In Wi-Fi, **performance** and **reliability** are affected by how data is packaged and transmitted. Two techniques that help optimize wireless communication are:

- **Fragmentation** – Breaking data into smaller pieces.
- **Aggregation** – Combining multiple data packets into one.

---

## ✂️ Fragmentation in Wi-Fi

### 📍 What is it?

**Fragmentation** divides a large data frame into smaller parts (fragments) before transmission.

### 💡 Why it’s used:

- To **reduce retransmission time** if a packet is lost or corrupted.
- Smaller fragments have a **higher chance of successful delivery**, especially in noisy environments.

### 🧠 How it works:

1. A large data frame is split into smaller fragments.
2. Each fragment is sent with its own **header** and **checksum**.
3. Only the **lost or corrupted fragment** needs to be retransmitted.

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Improved reliability** in environments with high interference.
- **Faster recovery** from transmission errors.

### ❌ Drawbacks:

- **More overhead** due to extra headers.
- Can **reduce throughput** if not managed properly.

---

## 📦 Aggregation in Wi-Fi

### 📍 What is it?

**Aggregation** combines multiple data packets into a **single larger frame** before transmission.

> Introduced in **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)** and enhanced in **Wi-Fi 5/6**, aggregation improves **efficiency**.

### 🧠 Types of Aggregation:

| **Type**    | **Full Name**                        | **Description**                                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A-MSDU**  | Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit     | Combines multiple data units at the **higher MAC layer**     |
| **A-MPDU**  | Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit    | Combines multiple MPDUs at the **lower MAC layer**           |

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Less overhead** (fewer headers per packet)
- **Higher throughput** and **better efficiency**
- Especially useful in **high-speed** or **low-error** environments

### ❌ Drawbacks:

- If one part of an aggregated frame is corrupted, **entire frame may need retransmission**
- **Delay-sensitive** applications may suffer due to buffering before aggregation

---
# 🧱 MPDU vs MSDU in Wi-Fi

In Wi-Fi communication, data flows through several layers. Two key units involved in packaging and transmitting this data are:

- **MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit)**
- **MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit)**

Understanding the difference between them helps in grasping how Wi-Fi handles data efficiency, error control, and speed.

---

## 📦 What is MSDU?

### ➕ Full Form:
**MAC Service Data Unit**

### 📍 Description:
An **MSDU** is a data packet received from the **upper layers** (like IP or TCP) and handed off to the **MAC layer** for transmission.

### 🔄 Example:
Think of it as a **customer's order** that needs to be packed before shipping.

### ✅ Key Points:

- Contains actual **payload** (user data)
- Sits at the **interface between Layer 2 and Layer 3** (Data Link ↔ Network)
- Before transmission, it's usually **converted into MPDU**

## ⚖️ Fragmentation vs Aggregation

|                | **Fragmentation**                          | **Aggregation**                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**     | Increase reliability                        | Improve efficiency and speed                 |
| **Use Case**    | Noisy environments, weak signals            | Clean environments, high-speed transmissions |
| **Overhead**    | High (more headers, more frames)            | Low (shared headers across packets)          |
| **Throughput**  | Can reduce throughput                       | Increases throughput                         |
| **Introduced In**| Legacy Wi-Fi (before 802.11n)              | 802.11n and later (Wi-Fi 4, 5, 6)            |

## 🏠 Real-World Analogy

### Fragmentation:
> Like sending multiple **smaller envelopes** instead of one big package when mailing fragile items — fewer chances of complete loss.

### Aggregation:
> Like putting several letters into a **single large envelope** to save on postage and time — more efficient, unless the envelope gets damaged.

---

## 🧠 Final Summary

- **Fragmentation** helps improve **reliability** by reducing the size of each transmission.
- **Aggregation** improves **efficiency** and **speed** by sending more data in fewer transmissions.
- **Modern Wi-Fi** standards use both smartly, depending on signal quality, traffic type, and device capability.

> 🚀 Efficient data handling = Faster Wi-Fi + Fewer errors!



# 🔋 Power Management in Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi devices (like phones, laptops, and IoT devices) often run on batteries. To **extend battery life**, Wi-Fi includes smart **power-saving mechanisms**.

---

## 🧠 Why Power Management Matters

- 🪫 Devices are **often idle** between data transmissions.
- ⚡ Wireless radios consume **significant power** when active.
- 💡 Power management allows devices to **sleep intelligently** without losing connectivity.

---

## ⚙️ How Power Management Works in Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi power-saving is based on a **client–AP (Access Point)** relationship.

### 🧱 Key Concepts:

| **Term**             | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sleep Mode**       | Client turns off its radio to save power                                     |
| **Listen Interval**  | Tells the AP how often the client wakes up to check for data                 |
| **Traffic Indication Map (TIM)** | Bitmap in beacon frames that indicates if AP has data for sleeping clients  |
| **Beacon Frame**     | Periodic signal from AP that includes the TIM and other control info         |
| **PS-Poll**          | Power Save Poll — client uses this to request queued data from AP            |

---

## 📶 Power Save Mechanism – Step by Step

1. **Client enters Power Save mode** and informs the AP.
2. AP **buffers data** for that client.
3. Client **wakes up periodically** based on the *Listen Interval*.
4. AP sends a **Beacon** with a TIM indicating buffered data.
5. Client sends a **PS-Poll** or triggers download to receive data.
6. After receiving, the client may **go back to sleep**.


## 🔋 Power Saving Mode (Legacy PS Mode only)

- Client sends a **null data frame** with the **Power Management bit set** to indicate it's entering sleep mode.
- The **Access Point (AP)** buffers any incoming data for the client while it’s asleep.
- AP includes a **TIM (Traffic Indication Map)** in its periodic **beacon frames**, signaling which clients have buffered data.
- When the client wakes up and sees its ID in the TIM, it sends a **PS-Poll** frame to request the buffered data from the AP.

---

## 💡 Types of Wi-Fi Power Saving Techniques

### 1. 💤 Legacy Power Save Mode

- Defined in early Wi-Fi standards.
- Based on **PS-Poll** mechanism and **beacon-based** listening.
- Still widely supported, but **not optimal** for modern use.

---

### 2. 🚀 WMM Power Save (U-APSD)

> **WMM = Wi-Fi Multimedia**  
> **U-APSD = Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery**

**WMM Power Save**, also known as **Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD)**, is an enhanced power-saving mechanism introduced with **Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM)**.

- Introduced to support **VoIP** and **real-time multimedia**.
- More **efficient** than legacy methods.
- Client tells AP when it’s ready, and AP **pushes** buffered packets.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- The client (STA) enters power-save mode.
- Instead of sending **PS-Poll** frames, the client sends a **trigger frame** (like a QoS data or null frame).
- The AP, upon receiving the trigger, delivers **all buffered packets** for that Access Category (AC).
- After delivery, the client may go back to sleep.

---

### 3. 📡 Target Wake Time (TWT) – Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Beyond

- AP and client **negotiate scheduled communication windows** to avoid unnecessary radio activity. 
- Great for **IoT devices** and **smart homes**.
- Dramatically reduces **power consumption** by avoiding unnecessary wakeups.

---
### ⚙️ How It Works

1. Client and AP agree on a **TWT schedule** — e.g., wake every 100ms.
2. Outside of the agreed window, the client **sleeps**.
3. At the TWT time, both AP and client **wake up and exchange data**.
4. The client goes back to sleep until the next window.

- 🕐 **TWT**: They and the teacher agree on *exact times* to meet. No wasted trips!

---

## ✅ Final Summary

- Wi-Fi uses **smart power-saving** to help mobile and IoT devices conserve energy.
- **Legacy**, **WMM Power Save**, and **TWT** are different techniques depending on device needs and Wi-Fi generation.
- Modern devices leverage **TWT** for scheduled, ultra-efficient communication.

# 💡 CAM (Constantly Awake Mode) in Wi-Fi

## 🔍 What is CAM?

**CAM** stands for **Constantly Awake Mode**. It is the **default power mode** in Wi-Fi where the device's radio is **always on** and actively listening for data or signals from the Access Point (AP).

---

## ⚙️ How CAM Works

In CAM:

- The Wi-Fi radio **never sleeps**.
- The device **immediately processes** all incoming and outgoing data.
- There is **no buffering** of data at the AP — the client is always ready.

---

## ✅ Advantages of CAM

| **Benefit**                  | **Explanation**                                           |

## 🔀 Band Switching: From 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz in Wi-Fi

Modern dual-band Wi-Fi networks operate on both:

- **2.4 GHz** (longer range, lower speed)
- **5 GHz** (shorter range, higher speed, less interference)

---

### 🧠 Why Switch from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz?

| **Reason**                  | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚀 **Faster Speeds**        | 5 GHz supports higher throughput (e.g., 802.11ac/ax), ideal for streaming, gaming |
| 🤫 **Less Congestion**      | 2.4 GHz is crowded (Bluetooth, microwaves, neighbors), 5 GHz has more channels   |
| 🎯 **Better QoS**           | APs may steer capable clients to 5 GHz for better load balancing                |

---

## 🔄 How Band Switching Happens (Client-Side)

When your device connects to Wi-Fi, here's what can happen:

### 1. **Initial Connection**
- Device scans both 2.4 and 5 GHz.
- If signal strength on 5 GHz is **too weak**, it may connect to **2.4 GHz** first.

### 2. **Monitoring Signal Quality**
- Device continuously monitors **RSSI**, **SNR**, **packet loss**, etc.
- If 5 GHz becomes viable (e.g., you walk closer to AP), it considers switching.

### 3. **Switch Triggered**
- The device **disconnects from 2.4 GHz** and **reassociates with 5 GHz** on same SSID.
- The AP may **assist** using **802.11k/v** to suggest a better band.

---

## 📡 AP-Assisted Band Steering

Enterprise-grade or mesh APs use **band steering**:

| **Technique**              | **What AP Does**                                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔕 **Ignore 2.4 GHz requests** | If client supports 5 GHz, AP may delay or reject 2.4 GHz probes             |
| 🧭 **802.11v BSS Transition** | AP suggests a 5 GHz BSSID via **BSS Transition Request**                   |
| 📊 **Load Balancing**         | AP monitors client count and may steer clients for better performance       |

> 🧠 Band steering is more like **“client suggestion”** — clients make the final roaming decision.

---

## 📶 Technical Example: iPhone Switches from 2.4 → 5 GHz

1. Initially connects to 2.4 GHz due to strong signal at range
2. As user moves closer, iPhone receives 5 GHz **beacon frames** with good RSSI
3. AP may send **802.11v BSS Transition Request** to 5 GHz BSSID
4. iPhone disconnects from 2.4 GHz and reassociates to 5 GHz using:
   - **Same SSID**
   - New **BSSID** on a 5 GHz channel
5. **DHCP is not redone** (same L3 settings usually retained)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tip

| **Symptom**                       | **Possible Cause**                        | **Fix**                          |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Stuck on 2.4 GHz                 | Weak 5 GHz signal or client preference    | Adjust AP power/band steering   |
| Flaky switching                  | Poor AP placement, no roaming support     | Enable 802.11k/v/r on AP        |
| No switch even near AP          | Device roaming aggressiveness is low      | Tweak client-side roaming settings (if possible) |

# 🔍 DFS Scan in Wi-Fi

DFS Scan is a special type of **passive channel scan** that access points (APs) must perform **before** using any **DFS channel** (radar-sensitive) in the 5 GHz band.

---

## ⚙️ What is a DFS Scan?

- Also known as **Channel Availability Check (CAC)**.
- It is a **mandatory listening period** where the AP checks for radar signals **before transmitting** on a DFS channel.
- The AP must stay **completely silent** during this scan.

---

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take?

| **Region** | **Scan Duration (CAC Time)** |
|------------|------------------------------|
| 🇺🇸 US (FCC) | **60 seconds**               |
| 🇪🇺 EU (ETSI) | **60 – 600 seconds** depending on channel |
| 🌏 Others     | **Usually 60 seconds**       |

> 🛑 During this time, the AP **won’t broadcast SSID** or allow connections on that channel.

---

## 📶 When Does DFS Scan Happen?

### 💡 Scenario 1: Initial Boot or Channel Change
- AP boots up and selects a DFS channel → **must perform DFS scan first**.
- No Wi-Fi service until the scan completes.

### 💡 Scenario 2: DFS Radar Detected
- AP already operating on a DFS channel.
- Radar appears → AP **immediately switches** to a new channel (DFS or non-DFS).
- If new channel is also DFS → another **DFS scan is triggered**.

---

## 🧠 What Happens During DFS Scan?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Client->>AP: Attempt to join network
AP--xClient: No beacon / no SSID broadcast
AP->>Itself: Listen silently for radar (60s)
Note right of AP: DFS scan in progress
AP->>All: Beacon starts on selected channel
Client->>AP: Association begins
```

# 📡 Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) Process

A **Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)** is a Layer 2 device that acts as a bridge between wireless client devices and the wired network (LAN).

It plays a central role in managing communication, association, and data forwarding in wireless networks.

---

## 🔁 Access Point Roles

- **Beacon Broadcasting**: Periodically advertises its presence and capabilities.
- **Authentication & Association Handling**: Manages connection requests from stations.
- **Frame Forwarding**: Routes data between wireless clients and the wired network.
- **Encryption Management**: Initiates and completes secure key handshakes (e.g., WPA2/WPA3).
- **QoS & Buffering**: Supports traffic prioritization and manages buffers (especially for sleeping clients).

---

## 🔄 Wi-Fi AP Process Workflow

### 1. **Beacon Frame Broadcast**

- AP periodically sends **beacon frames** on its operating channel.
- Beacon includes:
  - **SSID**
  - **Channel info**
  - **Supported data rates**
  - **Security capabilities**
  - **QoS and TIM (Traffic Indication Map)**

> 🔔 This is part of **passive scanning**—clients listen to beacons to discover networks.

---

### 2. **Handling Probe Requests (Active Scanning)**

- Client sends a **probe request** (with or without SSID).
- AP responds with a **probe response** containing:
  - Network info
  - Capabilities
  - Encryption methods

---

### 3. **Authentication Request**

- The client sends an **authentication request** to the AP.
- AP replies with an **authentication response** (accept or reject).

> 📌 This is **open system authentication** in most modern networks (pre-shared key authentication handled later via 4-way handshake).

---

### 4. **Association Request/Response**

- Once authenticated, client sends an **association request**:
  - SSID
  - Supported rates
  - Security capabilities
- AP sends an **association response**:
  - Status (success/failure)
  - Association ID (AID)

> ✅ After this, the client is fully associated and allowed to exchange data frames.

---

## 🔐 Optional: WPA2/WPA3 Four-Way Handshake

If encryption is enabled (WPA2/WPA3):

1. **AP sends ANonce** to client.
2. **Client generates PMK/PTK**, sends SNonce.
3. **AP generates PTK**, derives GTK, sends it to client.
4. **Client sends ACK** to complete the handshake.

> 🔑 This step ensures both sides share secure session keys.

---

## 🔁 Frame Forwarding & Data Handling

- Once associated:
  - AP receives **data frames** from clients.
  - Forwards them to:
    - Another wireless client (intra-BSS)
    - Or a wired LAN endpoint (via **DS** – Distribution System)

---

## 💤 Power Save Mode Handling

- AP buffers packets for clients in **sleep mode**.
- AP sets **TIM flag** in beacon to notify pending data.
- Client wakes up and sends **PS-Poll frame** to retrieve data.

---

## 📶 AP Channel Management

- Operates on a fixed or dynamic channel in 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz bands.
- May support:
  - **Channel bonding** (40/80/160 MHz)
  - **DFS** (Dynamic Frequency Selection)
  - **Band Steering** (2.4 → 5GHz steering)

---

## 🧠 Other AP Features

- **QoS Management**: Uses WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) to prioritize traffic.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes clients among neighboring APs (in ESS).
- **Client Isolation**: Prevents client-to-client traffic on the same BSS.
- **Roaming Support**: Coordinates with other APs in ESS for seamless handover.

# 🌐 How a Wireless Access Point (AP) Provides Internet/Data Access

When you connect your phone or laptop to Wi-Fi, you're actually communicating with a **Wireless Access Point (AP)**. But how does that AP give you access to the internet? Let's break it down step by step.

---

## 📡 Step 1: Device Connects to the AP

1. Your device (called a **station** or **STA**) turns on Wi-Fi.
2. It scans for available networks (either **passively** by listening to beacon frames or **actively** by sending probe requests).
3. When you select a network (SSID), your device sends:
   - **Authentication Request**
   - **Association Request**
4. AP responds and **establishes the connection**.

✅ Now your device is connected **to the AP**, but it doesn’t yet have internet access.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: AP Acts as a Bridge or Gateway

Once connected, the AP needs to **bridge your device to the internet**. It does this in one of two roles:

### 1. **Bridge Mode**

- The AP is **just a wireless extension** of a wired router.
- It passes traffic back and forth **without assigning IP addresses**.
- The **router** handles DHCP (assigning IPs) and internet routing.

### 2. **Router Mode (Standalone AP)**

- The AP itself has **routing capability**.
- It performs **DHCP, NAT, DNS**, and **routes traffic** to the internet.

> 📝 Most home routers combine both AP + Router + DHCP Server in one device (like TP-Link, Netgear, etc.).

---

## 🗂️ Step 3: Device Gets an IP Address (DHCP)

To talk on any network, your device needs an **IP address**.

### Here's how it works (automatically via DHCP):

1. Your device sends a **DHCP Discover** message (broadcast).
2. The AP (or router) replies with a **DHCP Offer** (suggesting an IP address).
3. Your device responds with **DHCP Request** (accepting the offer).
4. The AP replies with **DHCP ACK** (confirmation).

> 🎯 Now your device has:
> - IP address (e.g., `192.168.0.101`)
> - Subnet mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0`)
> - Default gateway (the AP/router IP, e.g., `192.168.0.1`)
> - DNS server address

---

## 🌍 Step 4: Device Sends a Request to the Internet

Let’s say you open a browser and go to `www.google.com`.

1. Your device sends a **DNS request** to find Google’s IP.
2. DNS server replies: `www.google.com` → `142.250.182.36`
3. Your device sends a **data packet** to that IP address.
4. The AP/router **receives the packet** and forwards it to your **internet provider (ISP)** via the modem.

---

## 🔄 Step 5: AP Uses NAT (Network Address Translation)

Your AP shares one **public IP address** (from the ISP) among multiple devices.

- It keeps a **mapping table** of who sent what request.
- This process is called **NAT (Network Address Translation)**.
- So when Google replies, the AP knows which internal device (you) to send it to.

> 📦 NAT allows **many private devices** to use **one public IP**.

---

## 🚥 Step 6: Internet Data Comes Back

- The internet server (like Google) replies to your request.
- The AP receives the data, looks up the correct client, and **forwards it to your device over Wi-Fi**.
- This happens **in milliseconds**.

✅ Congratulations! You now have internet access.

# 🏠 Real-World Analogy

**Think of your Wi-Fi Access Point like a receptionist at an office:**

- 🧑‍💻 You (*the device*) ask the receptionist for internet access.
- 🪪 The receptionist gives you an **ID badge** (*IP address*).
- 📤 When you send a letter (*data*), the receptionist logs your name and sends it out.
- 📥 When mail comes back (*a reply*), the receptionist knows it's for you and hands it over.

---

# ✅ Final Summary

📶 Your **device** connects to the **Access Point (AP)** via **Wi-Fi**.

- The **AP/router** assigns your device an IP address using **DHCP**.
- Your device sends **data to the internet**, and the AP handles the forwarding.
- The AP uses **NAT** to allow multiple devices to **share one internet connection**.
- Incoming data is routed **back to the correct device** using the IP address.

# 📡 The AP is your **wireless gateway** to the digital world!


# 📡 Ad-Hoc & Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) Operation - Deep Technical Dive

This guide explores two decentralized wireless networking models:

* **Ad-Hoc Mode** (IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set)
* **Wi-Fi Direct** (P2P - Peer-to-Peer Mode)

---

## 🧩 1. Ad-Hoc Mode (IBSS)

### 🔍 Concept

Ad-Hoc mode allows Wi-Fi-capable devices to communicate directly without an access point (AP). It's useful for simple, short-term or mesh-like wireless networks.

### ⚙️ Technical Characteristics

- **No Access Point**: Fully peer-to-peer.
- **Shared SSID**: All devices use the same SSID and channel.
- **Randomized BSSID**: Typically the MAC address of the initiating node.
- **Beaconing**: All nodes may send beacon frames; one acts as a timing master.
- **Frame Addressing**:
  - `To DS = 0`, `From DS = 0`
  - `Address1 = Destination`, `Address2 = Source`, `Address3 = BSSID`

### 🔄 Formation Process

1. One device creates an IBSS with an SSID and channel.
2. Others scan and join by matching SSID and channel.
3. Synchronization and periodic beaconing occur.

### ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ No QoS
- ❌ No security enforcement (encryption optional)
- ❌ Poor power management
- ⚠️ Poor scalability; not suitable for complex networks
- ⚠️ Largely deprecated in modern OSes

---

# 🔁 Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) – Deep Technical Dive

---

## 🧠 Concept

Wi-Fi Direct allows two or more Wi-Fi-enabled devices to communicate directly **without needing a traditional Access Point (AP)**. It builds upon the **IEEE 802.11 standard** and adds functionality via the **Wi-Fi Alliance P2P specification**.

Unlike Ad-Hoc (IBSS), Wi-Fi Direct introduces structure and security by **emulating infrastructure mode** — one device becomes a **Group Owner (GO)**, and others become **clients**.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 👤 Entities and Their Roles

| Entity             | Role                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **P2P Device**     | A Wi-Fi-capable device with P2P support (e.g., smartphone, printer)  |
| **Group Owner (GO)**| Becomes a soft AP for the group                                      |
| **P2P Client**     | Joins a group managed by the GO                                      |
| **Persistent Group**| Previously formed group remembered for seamless reconnection         |
| **WPS Registrar**  | Manages key exchange and PIN/PBC security during provisioning        |

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

## 🧭 Group Formation - Deep Protocol Phases

### Phase 1: **Device Discovery**

- Uses **social channels** (1, 6, 11).
- Devices alternate between **search** and **listen** states.
- **Probe Requests** and **Probe Responses** carry **P2P IE (Information Element)**:
  - `P2P Capability`
  - `Device Info` (MAC, device name, etc.)
  - `Group Info`
  - `Channel List`
  - `Intended P2P Interface Address`

🧪 Tools: Capture traffic in **Wireshark** (Monitor Mode), filter on `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x04` (probe req) and `0x05` (probe resp)

---

### Phase 2: **GO Negotiation**

A three-way handshake to decide who becomes **Group Owner**:

1. **GO Negotiation Request**
2. **GO Negotiation Response**
3. **GO Negotiation Confirmation**

> 📌 Each device declares a **GO Intent value (0–15)** in the P2P IE.
> The higher number wins. If equal, a **tie-breaker bit** is used.

P2P IE contains:

- `GO Intent`
- `GO Device Address`
- `Config Timeout`
- `Operating Channel`

---

### Phase 3: **Provisioning (Authentication)**

Once the GO is elected:

- The group is provisioned via **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)** using:
  - **Push Button Configuration (PBC)**
  - **PIN Entry** (display or input)

> 🔐 WPA2-PSK or WPA3-SAE key generation occurs here.

Each device undergoes a **4-way handshake** post-WPS to establish **Pairwise Temporal Keys (PTKs)**.

---

### Phase 4: **Group Formation**

- GO creates a **soft AP interface** (e.g., `p2p-wlan0-0`)
- Starts **beaconing** with:
  - SSID like `DIRECT-XY-[DeviceName]`
  - Beacon frames carry **P2P IE** and **WPS IE**
- Clients scan, authenticate, associate, and obtain an IP via **DHCP** or **APIPA**

---

### Phase 5: **Persistent Groups**

- Devices cache:
  - Group SSID
  - PSK credentials
  - Roles (GO or Client)
- On rediscovery, they reconnect **without repeating GO negotiation**.

---

### Phase 6: **Autonomous Group Formation**

- A device **preemptively** becomes GO:
  - Creates a group locally
  - Beacon frames announce the group
- Other P2P devices may scan and connect directly

---

## 🌐 After Group Formation - Layer Breakdown

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Beaconing**| GO sends beacon frames with P2P IE and SSID                                 |
| **Auth**     | WPA2/WPA3 encryption (like standard AP-based Wi-Fi)                         |
| **IP Address**| GO typically runs a **DHCP server**; Clients get IP dynamically            |
| **Power Save**| P2P clients can enter PS mode; GO uses **Notice of Absence (NoA)**         |
| **Service Discovery** | Clients query GO using **DNS-SD**, **Bonjour**, or **UPnP**        |

# 🔁 Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) Group Formation – Deep Dive

Wi-Fi Direct allows two or more Wi-Fi devices to communicate **without a traditional access point**, using standard 802.11 protocols enhanced by P2P negotiation, provisioning, and discovery mechanisms.

---

## 📚 Overview of Group Formation Types

| Type                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard GO Negotiation** | Two devices negotiate a GO (Group Owner) via intent value exchange        |
| **Persistent Group**        | Devices remember credentials and roles from a previous session            |
| **Autonomous GO**           | One device self-declares as GO and starts broadcasting                   |
| **Invitation Procedure**    | Reconnection to a persistent group using invitation request/response     |

---

## 1️⃣ Standard GO Negotiation (Dynamic Formation)

### ✅ Use Case:
- First-time connection between devices.
- Neither device pre-configured as GO.

### 🧭 Step-by-Step:

1. **Device Discovery**
   - Devices scan social channels (1, 6, 11)
   - Exchange `Probe Request/Response` with P2P IE (Information Element)

2. **GO Negotiation Phase**
   - Device A sends: `GO Negotiation Request (Intent = 7)`
   - Device B replies: `GO Negotiation Response (Intent = 10)`
   - Device A confirms: `GO Negotiation Confirmation`
   - Higher `Intent` wins; if tied, a tiebreaker bit is used.

3. **Provisioning Phase**
   - WPS setup (Push Button / PIN)
   - Device roles are temporarily established
   - Credentials (PSK or SAE) exchanged securely

4. **Group Formation**
   - GO starts beaconing with `DIRECT-XXXX` SSID
   - Client performs `WPA2 4-Way Handshake`
   - DHCP negotiation assigns IP to client

### 📊 Packet Exchange:

| Sender     | Message                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| A          | Probe Request (P2P IE)                   |
| B          | Probe Response (P2P IE)                  |
| A → B      | GO Negotiation Request                   |
| B → A      | GO Negotiation Response                  |
| A → B      | GO Negotiation Confirmation              |
| B (GO)     | Beacon Frames (SSID, P2P Group Info)     |
| A → GO     | WPS Authentication                       |
| GO ↔ A     | WPA2 4-Way Handshake                     |
| GO → A     | DHCP Offer (if using DHCP)               |

---

## 2️⃣ Persistent Group

### ✅ Use Case:
- Devices have connected before.
- Bypass full GO negotiation next time.

### 🧭 Key Characteristics:

- During provisioning, both devices may agree to **store credentials** (via `Persistent` flag).
- On reconnection, either side can send an **Invitation Request** to rejoin a group.
- The previously elected GO resumes its role.

### 📦 Messages:
- `Invitation Request` → contains Group Info and optional GO role indication
- `Invitation Response` → acknowledges group restoration

---

## 3️⃣ Autonomous GO

### ✅ Use Case:
- A device wants to act as an AP-like server without negotiation.

### 🧭 Behavior:

- Device configures itself as a **Group Owner** in advance.
- Immediately starts beaconing with `DIRECT-XXXX` SSID on a chosen channel.
- Waits for peers to join (like a soft AP).
- No GO negotiation is required.

### 📝 Real-World Examples:
- Smart TVs, printers, or file servers acting as permanent GOs.
- Miracast source devices like laptops.

---

## 4️⃣ Invitation Procedure (Re-Forming Persistent Groups)

### ✅ Use Case:
- Fast reconnection to an existing group.
- Especially useful for app-to-app communications.

### 🧭 Steps:

1. Device A sends `P2P Invitation Request`
   - Includes: Persistent Group ID, Device Address, and optionally GO intent
2. Device B responds with `P2P Invitation Response`
   - Includes status (accepted, rejected, timed out)

## 📦 P2P Information Elements (IE) in Wi-Fi Frames

P2P-specific data is embedded in standard Wi-Fi frames (e.g. Beacons, Probe Requests, GO Negotiation frames).

### 🧬 P2P IE Structure

Each P2P IE follows this format:

* **Element ID**: `0xDD` (Vendor Specific)
* **Length**: Total length of this IE
* **OUI**: `50 6F 9A` (Wi-Fi Alliance OUI)
* **OUI Type**: `09` (P2P)
* **P2P Attributes**: Sequence of TLV (Type-Length-Value) blocks

### 📄 Example P2P Attributes

| Type | Attribute Name        | Description                    |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x00 | P2P Capability        | Group/Device capabilities      |
| 0x01 | P2P Device ID         | MAC address of device          |
| 0x02 | Group Owner Intent    | GO score: higher wins          |
| 0x04 | Configuration Timeout | Timeout during connection      |
| 0x06 | P2P Group ID          | SSID + Device Address          |
| 0x0D | Channel List          | Supported channels/frequencies |
| 0x0E | Notice of Absence     | Power saving scheduling        |
| 0x0F | Device Info           | Manufacturer, device name, etc |

### 📘 Used In Frames:

* Probe Request/Response
* GO Negotiation Request/Response/Confirm
* Association Request
* Beacon (for GO)

### 🧠 Notes:

* Devices parse P2P IE to evaluate capabilities of peers.
* Helps determine channel, WPS method, intent score, etc.
* `Group Owner Intent` plays a major role in deciding who becomes GO.

## 🌐 Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint Deep Dive

### 📘 What is Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint?

* **Hotspot 2.0**, also known as **Passpoint**, is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification aimed at making public Wi-Fi access seamless and secure—just like cellular networks.
* Built on **IEEE 802.11u**, with extensions for secure authentication, automatic provisioning, and roaming.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term          | Meaning                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ANQP**      | Access Network Query Protocol — protocol for client to discover network details before associating  |
| **OSU**       | Online Sign-Up — secure method to provision credentials over HTTPS                                  |
| **EAP**       | Extensible Authentication Protocol — supports secure authentication like EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA |
| **AAA**       | Authentication, Authorization, Accounting — back-end service, often RADIUS                          |
| **NAI Realm** | Network Access Identifier — identifies home service provider                                        |
| **HESSID**    | Homogeneous Extended Service Set ID — like BSSID, used to identify network groups                   |

### 📡 Operational Flow

1. **Discovery Phase**

   * Client sends Probe Request
   * AP responds with **ANQP Response** containing:

     * Supported Roaming Consortium
     * Venue Name
     * Network Type (e.g., free, commercial)
     * NAI Realms
     * IP Capability
     * WAN Metrics

2. **Authentication**

   * If client has credentials for roaming consortium, it connects using EAP (e.g., EAP-SIM/TTLS/AKA)

3. **Provisioning (if no credentials)**

   * Client connects to **OSU SSID**
   * HTTPS used to securely download a profile
   * Device stores credentials for future use

4. **Roaming**

   * Once provisioned, user can roam between providers using same identity (SIM, certificate, username)

### 🔧 Backend RADIUS + EAP (TTLS / SIM / AKA)

When the client decides to authenticate, the access point forwards the authentication to a **RADIUS server**, which handles AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting).

#### 🔐 EAP-TTLS Flow (Username + Password)

1. Client sends EAP-Request to AP
2. AP forwards to RADIUS server
3. RADIUS and client set up TLS tunnel
4. Inside the tunnel, user credentials are validated
5. If valid, server sends EAP-Success
6. Session keys are derived → 802.11 association completed

#### 📱 EAP-SIM / EAP-AKA (SIM-Based Auth)

* Used in mobile devices (smartphones, tablets)
* SIM card generates authentication tokens
* RADIUS server forwards to **Mobile Core** or **HSS/HLR** to validate SIM
* Enables **seamless roaming** just like LTE/5G

#### 🔐 Certificates (EAP-TLS)

* Uses X.509 certificates on both client and server
* Strongest security, but provisioning is harder

### 🧪 Real Frame Exchange

* **Client sends:** Probe Request (with Hotspot 2.0 capability)
* **AP replies with:** Probe Response + ANQP advertisement
* **Client issues:** ANQP Query (NAI Realm, Roaming Consortium, etc.)
* **AP sends:** ANQP Response
* **Client decides:** Whether to authenticate or use OSU provisioning
* **Authentication:** EAP-based (handled via RADIUS)

### 🧪 Real-World Tools

* `hostapd` with Hotspot 2.0 config
* `wpa_supplicant` with Passpoint credentials
* `wireshark` filters: `anqp`, `hs20`, `eap`
* Supported in Android (>=4.4), iOS (>=7), Windows 10+

### 🆚 Regular AP vs Passpoint AP

# 📡 Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) and Advanced Wi-Fi Operation

---

## 📘 What is Wi-Fi Aware (NAN - Neighbor Awareness Networking)?

* **Wi-Fi Aware** is a peer-to-peer discovery and communication protocol based on **IEEE 802.11mc**.
* Enables continuous background discovery without requiring an internet connection or access point.
* Built for **proximity-based services**: file sharing, multiplayer gaming, location-aware apps, etc.
* Unlike Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Aware focuses more on discovery and low-latency communication using a shared aware infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term                            | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NAN Master Indication (NMI)** | Indicates which peer acts as the synchronization anchor               |
| **Service Hash**                | Unique hash that represents a service being advertised                |
| **Discovery Window**            | Time interval when nodes wake up to listen or transmit                |
| **Publish / Subscribe**         | Core paradigm — advertise (publish) or listen (subscribe) to services |
| **SDF / FSD / USF**             | Types of Service Discovery Frames: Solicited/Unsolicited              |
| **NAN Cluster**                 | Group of devices synchronized via a Master Election protocol          |
| **Synchronization Beacon**      | Broadcast by master to maintain time sync across cluster              |

---

## 🔄 Operational Workflow

### 1. **Cluster Formation (Discovery and Sync Phase)**

* Devices start by scanning for **NAN beacons**.
* Each device evaluates if a cluster exists; if not, it becomes a **Master**.
* Master sends out **Synchronization Beacons (NAN Sync Beacons)**.
* Other devices sync their clocks and join the cluster as **slaves**.

### 2. **Service Discovery (Publish / Subscribe)**

* **Publish**:

  * Device announces a service (e.g., multiplayer game available).
  * Can be **solicited** (expects a response) or **unsolicited**.

* **Subscribe**:

  * Another device listens for service hash that matches.
  * If match is found, a response is sent.

* Discovery uses **NAN SDF frames** with TLVs (Type-Length-Value):

  * Service Hash
  * Service Info
  * Match Filter

### 3. **Secure Data Path Setup (NAN Data Path - NDP)**

* After discovery:

  * Devices exchange **NDP Setup Request / Response**
  * Negotiate channel, security (e.g., PMKID, MAC addresses)
  * Establish a **direct peer-to-peer data path** using Wi-Fi

* Uses **NDI (NAN Data Interface)** to send traffic outside of traditional IP stack

---

## 🧬 Wi-Fi Aware Frame Types

| Frame Type                        | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sync Beacon**                   | Sent by master — includes timing, cluster ID                 |
| **Sync + Discovery**              | Combined frame for synchronization and service advertisement |
| **SDF (Service Discovery Frame)** | Carries service name, match filter, etc.                     |
| **NDP Setup Req/Resp**            | Used to initiate and confirm data path setup                 |
| **NDPE**                          | Encapsulation for sending user data over NDP                 |

---

## 🔒 Security

* NAN itself is discovery focused, but for NDP:

  * Encryption is possible with **PMK (Pairwise Master Key)** or **PMKID**
  * Some implementations rely on Wi-Fi Protected Management Frames
  * Identity protection is minimal by default — security is app-layer driven

---

* Defines **Access Categories (ACs)**:

  * **AC\_VO**: Voice
  * **AC\_VI**: Video
  * **AC\_BE**: Best Effort
  * **AC\_BK**: Background

Each AC has its own **Contention Window (CW)** and **Arbitration Inter-Frame Space (AIFS)**:

* Voice gets smallest CW and AIFS → prioritized
* Background gets largest → deprioritized

### ⚙️ WMM Parameters Table

| AC | CWmin | CWmax | AIFS | TXOP Limit |
| -- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| VO | 3     | 7     | 2    | 1.504 ms   |

# 🚀 Final Deep Dive: Target Wake Time (TWT) & IEEE 802.11p

---

## ⏰ Target Wake Time (TWT) — Wi-Fi 6 / 6E / 7 Power Optimization

### 📘 What is TWT?

TWT (Target Wake Time) is a power-saving mechanism introduced in **IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**. It allows devices (STAs) to **negotiate specific times** with the Access Point (AP) to wake up for transmissions.

This reduces the time the radio stays awake — critical for **IoT, wearables, mobile clients**, and **dense network** scenarios.

---

### ⚙️ How TWT Works

#### 🧩 Types of TWT Agreements

* **Individual TWT**: Specific to a client (STA and AP negotiate directly)
* **Broadcast TWT**: AP schedules a group of STAs to wake at the same time

#### 🗂️ Key Parameters in a TWT Agreement

* **TWT Wake Interval**: How often to wake (in TU — Time Units)
* **TWT Duration**: How long to stay awake after waking
* **TWT Target Time**: Exact wake-up moment (relative to Beacon time)
* **TWT Flow Identifier**: Identifies TWT sessions

---

### 🔄 TWT Negotiation Process

1. **TWT Request Frame** (from STA)
2. **TWT Response Frame** (from AP): Accept/Decline + parameters
3. STA configures its sleep/wake schedule

#### 💡 Implementation Insights

* TWT IE (Information Element) is embedded in **Action Frames**
* Uses **Management Action Frame Category: QoS Management**
* Bit fields indicate negotiation type (Request, Accept, Teardown, etc.)

---

### 📉 Benefits of TWT

* 💤 **Power Efficiency**: Clients sleep for longer intervals
* 📶 **Reduced Contention**: Predictable wake-ups lower airtime contention
* 🔋 **Battery Gains**: Especially for Wi-Fi 6 IoT devices

    participant App as V2X Application

    RSU->>OBU: WAVE Service Advertisement (WSA)
    note right of OBU: Receives WSA with service info (channel, port, etc.)

    OBU->>RSU: Join requested service (optional, depends on app)
    RSU->>OBU: WAVE Short Message (WSM)

    OBU->>App: Pass WSM to higher-layer (e.g., DENM/CAM)
    App->>OBU: Generate CAM/DENM message
    OBU-->>RSU: WSM (containing CAM or DENM payload)
```
### 🚗 Use Cases

* Collision avoidance
* Traffic signal alerts
* Emergency vehicle priority
* Platooning & Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)

---

### ⚙️ PHY/MAC Differences (from 802.11a)

* **OFDM-based** like 802.11a
* **10 MHz channel bandwidth** (vs 20 MHz in 802.11a)
* **No association process** — "connectionless mode"
* **Wildcard BSSID** used (since no AP association)
* **No encryption/authentication** in base spec (safety prioritized over security)

---

### 🔄 Frame Exchange in 802.11p

* Data exchange starts directly using wildcard BSSID
* Beaconing still used for service announcements
* Uses **WAVE Service Advertisements (WSA)** to indicate app-level services

---

### 🧪 Performance Aspects

* Lower PHY rate than 11a (due to 10 MHz)
* Highly tolerant to delay, Doppler shifts
* Designed for **high-mobility scenarios** (>100 km/h)

---

### 🔐 Security Extensions

802.11p alone doesn't define security — usually coupled with:

* **IEEE 1609.2** (security for vehicular messages)
* **PKI-based certificates** for trusted messages

---

### 🛠️ Simulation/Testing Tools

* **NS-3** with `wave` module
* **OMNeT++** + Veins + SUMO for mobility
* Wireshark with DSRC support (some experimental patches)
