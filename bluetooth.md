# Part 1 – Classic Bluetooth vs BLE

You already know **BLE** is:
- Low energy, short bursts of data
- GATT services/characteristics
- Optimized for sensors, wearables

**Classic Bluetooth**:
- Designed for continuous streaming or higher data throughput
- Uses profiles (SPP, A2DP, HFP, HID, etc.) rather than GATT
- Usually higher power than BLE
- Backward compatibility with older devices

### Key Differences Table

| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Data Rate      | ~1Mbps                | Up to 3Mbps (EDR)               |
| Latency        | Low for short packets | Higher, but continuous          |
| Use Cases      | Sensors, beacons, fitness | Audio, serial data, keyboards, file transfer |
| Architecture   | GATT Services/Characteristics | Profiles over RFCOMM, L2CAP     |

# Part 2 – Classic Bluetooth Architecture

**Classic Bluetooth stack layers:**
- **Radio** – Physical wireless link (2.4GHz ISM)
- **Baseband** – Controls physical channel, device addressing
- **L2CAP** – Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (multiplexing, packet segmentation)
- **RFCOMM** – Serial port emulation (SPP profile)
- **Profiles** – Define application behavior (SPP, A2DP, HFP, etc.)

---

# Part 3 – Coding Basics

Assuming **Android** development (Java/Kotlin). If you need for ESP32 or Linux BlueZ, let me know.

**Example: Discover Classic Bluetooth Devices (Android, Java/Kotlin)**
```java
BluetoothAdapter bluetoothAdapter = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter();
if (bluetoothAdapter == null) {
Log.e("BT", "Device doesn't support Bluetooth");
} else if (!bluetoothAdapter.isEnabled()) {
Intent enableBtIntent = new Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE);
startActivityForResult(enableBtIntent, REQUEST_ENABLE_BT);
}

// Start discovery
bluetoothAdapter.startDiscovery();

// Listen for found devices
private final BroadcastReceiver receiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
String action = intent.getAction();
if (BluetoothDevice.ACTION_FOUND.equals(action)) {
BluetoothDevice device = intent.getParcelableExtra(BluetoothDevice.EXTRA_DEVICE);
Log.i("BT", "Found device: " + device.getName() + " - " + device.getAddress());
}
}
};
```

# Comparing BLE GATT and Classic Bluetooth SPP

compare BLE GATT with something very similar in Classic Bluetooth — the SPP (Serial Port Profile) — since both  for general-purpose, arbitrary data exchange, but their stack architectures and data-handling paradigms are quite different.

---

## 1. Architecture Difference — BLE vs Classic Bluetooth

### **BLE Stack Architecture**
Application
  ↑
GATT (Services / Characteristics)
  ↑
ATT (Attribute Protocol)
  ↑
L2CAP (Low Energy mode)
  ↑
Link Layer (BLE-specific)
  ↑
Radio (2.4 GHz)



- **GATT** (Generic Attribute Profile) is the main application-level protocol that structures data as "Services" (containers) and "Characteristics" (data points).
- **ATT** (Attribute Protocol) moves these attributes (data units) around.
- **L2CAP** in BLE is simplified, optimized for low energy.
- Devices advertise services/characteristics; interactions are attribute-based.

---



### Classic Bluetooth Stack

Application
  ↑
Profile (e.g., SPP, A2DP, HFP)
  ↑
RFCOMM (Serial Port Emulation) / Other profile transport
  ↑
L2CAP (Full-featured, multiplexing channels)
  ↑
Baseband
  ↑
Radio (2.4 GHz)

- **Profiles**: Instead of GATT, Classic Bluetooth uses Profiles — predefined rules for use cases (e.g., SPP for serial, A2DP for audio).
- **SPP** (Serial Port Profile) emulates a serial port, allowing bidirectional byte streams as if over RS-232, ideal for serial data exchange between devices.
- **RFCOMM** provides the "virtual serial cable."
- **L2CAP** here is more capable: supports multiple streams and greater throughput; not optimized for energy efficiency.

## **Key Points of Comparison**

| Layer/Concept  | BLE (GATT)                                | Classic Bluetooth (SPP)                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Stack Top**  | GATT (Services & Characteristics)         | Profile (e.g., SPP)                            |
| **Transport**  | ATT (attribute-based transactions)        | RFCOMM (serial port emulation)                  |
| **L2CAP**      | Simplified for low energy                 | Full-featured, supports channel multiplexing    |
| **Data Model** | Structured: Services & Characteristics    | Unstructured: Byte stream                       |
| **Use Case**   | Sensors, control/status, small data       | Serial replacement, bulk continuous data        |
| **Power**      | Low power, connectionless by default      | Higher power, continuous connections            |

- **GATT vs. SPP**: GATT organizes data in a hierarchical, structured way (services/characteristics), while SPP offers a simple, virtual serial port with just raw byte transmission.
- **BLE GATT** is best for applications needing low power, intermittent communications.
- **SPP** excels for legacy serial devices or whenever you want seamless, bidirectional data streaming[7][13][15].

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Data Structure   | Services, Characteristics             | Simple byte stream                            |

| Best Use Case    | IoT, sensors, status/control devices  | Serial port replacement, Arduino, bulk data   |

This highlights the core differences between BLE GATT and Classic Bluetooth SPP — both enable flexible data transfer but are architected for very different use-cases and constraints.

# Flow Comparison — Connecting & Exchanging Data

Both **BLE GATT** and **Classic Bluetooth SPP** enable device-to-device communication, but their connection flows and interaction styles differ significantly.

---

## **BLE GATT Flow**  
*(Example: Reading temperature from a BLE sensor)*

1. **Scan for devices** — Listen for *advertisements* broadcast by nearby BLE devices.
2. **Connect** — Establish a link at the BLE Link Layer.
3. **Discover services & characteristics** — Query the device for available GATT services (containers) and characteristics (data points).
4. **Read characteristic value** — Request a specific characteristic; data flows through:  
   `ATT → L2CAP (Low Energy) → Link Layer → Radio (2.4 GHz)`
5. **Disconnect** — Close the connection to conserve power.

---

## **Classic Bluetooth SPP Flow**  
*(Example: Sending text to a microcontroller)*

1. **Inquiry scan** — Search for nearby Classic Bluetooth devices.
2. **Pair / bond** — Exchange a PIN code or complete authentication.
3. **Connect to RFCOMM channel** — Use the SPP-assigned channel for serial communication.
4. **Send/receive data** — Exchange bytes in a continuous stream, like a UART over wireless.
5. **Disconnect** — End the session when done.

---

## **Key Insight**

> **SPP is like "GATT without the database"** —  
> - BLE GATT imposes a *structured data model* (services & characteristics).  
> - SPP gives you a *raw bidirectional data pipe* you can write bytes into and read from, with no predefined schema.

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| **Authentication**  | Optional (pairing depends on config)        | Usually requires PIN pairing         |
| **Connection**      | Link Layer connection                       | RFCOMM channel connection            |
| **Data Format**     | Structured (services/characteristics)       | Raw byte stream                      |
| **Overhead**        | Higher (due to discovery & attribute reads)  | Lower (direct byte send/receive)     |
| **Power Use**       | Low (short bursts)                          | Higher (continuous connection)       |
| **Best For**        | Small structured sensor/control data         | Bulk or continuous serial data flow  |
